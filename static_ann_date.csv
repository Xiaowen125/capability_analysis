Shareholders Accept C$42.75 (US$40.13) Per Share Offer


- Offer is 40% premium over ""undisturbed share price""

- Closing targeted for first quarter, 2008



MONTREAL, June 30 /CNW Telbec/ - BCE (TSX/NYSE: BCE) today announced that the
company has entered into a definitive agreement for BCE to be acquired by an
investor group led by Teachers Private Capital, the private investment arm of
the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Providence Equity Partners Inc. and Madison
Dearborn Partners, LLC. The all-cash transaction is valued at C$51.7 billion
(US$48.5 billion), including C$16.9 billion (US$15.9 billion) of debt,
preferred equity and minority interests. The BCE Board of Directors unanimously
recommends that shareholders vote to accept the offer.

Under the terms of the transaction, the investor group will acquire all of the
common shares of BCE not already owned by Teachers for an offer price of
C$42.75 per common share and all preferred shares at the prices set forth in
the attached schedule. Financing for the transaction is fully committed through
a syndicate of banks acting on behalf of the purchaser. The purchase price
represents a 40% premium over the undisturbed average trading price of BCE
common shares in the first quarter of 2007, prior to the possibility of a
privatization transaction surfacing publicly. The transaction values BCE at 7.8
times EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization)
for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2007.

""This proposed transaction concludes a comprehensive and disciplined review of
the company's strategic alternatives launched April 17,"" said Richard J.
Currie, Chairman of the Board of BCE. ""It will deliver substantial value
creation for our shareholders. In addition, a majority of the equity will be
owned by Canadians.""

""The transaction delivers to our shareholders the economic benefit of the work
done to focus on our core business and to strengthen Bell with a new cost
structure and new competitive capabilities,"" said Michael Sabia, President and
CEO of BCE. ""All members of the investor group have outstanding track records
in building strong and resilient enterprises and they share our commitment to
customers, our employees and the communities we serve.""

""It is gratifying to see that BCE's Board of Directors shares our vision for
this initiative, and we are honoured to lead the largest buyout transaction in
Canadian corporate history,"" said Jim Leech, Senior Vice-President, Teachers'
Private Capital, noting that Teachers has been a major BCE shareholder since
the early 1990s. ""The Board has recognized our commitment to BCE's ongoing
growth potential, through our proposed investment strategy. We made it clear in
our proposal that we have carefully considered the potential for BCE and its
ongoing status as a Canadian icon. We strongly believe that all BCE
shareholders, Canadian consumers, and employees, including senior management,
who will continue to direct the company from its headquarters in Montreal, will
benefit from this transaction. We look forward to working together with BCE to
make this a reality.""

""This is a unique opportunity to contribute to and participate in the growth of
one of the world's most significant communications companies,"" said Jonathan M.
Nelson, Chief Executive Officer of Providence Equity Partners. ""BCE offers
state of the art services through its sophisticated network that extends
throughout Canada. We look forward to working with BCE's talented management
and employees and our partners to build on the strong platform that is in place
for the benefit of all of the company's stakeholders.""

The equity ownership of BCE would be as follows: Teachers Private Capital 52%,
Providence 32%, Madison Dearborn 9% and other Canadian investors 7%.

The purchaser has obtained a debt commitment to finance the transaction subject
to usual terms for these types of financings. The purchaser anticipates
requiring BCE, Bell Canada and Bell Mobility to redeem outstanding redeemable
debentures maturing up to August 2010 pursuant to their terms as of and subject
to the closing of the transaction. The acquisition debt financing would become
an obligation of BCE and be guaranteed by BCE's then subsidiaries (other than
Bell Aliant Regional Communications Income Fund and Northwestel Inc.). As to
Bell Canada, the purchaser's financing would comply as to ranking and security
with the then existing Bell Canada debentures and medium term notes issued
under the 1976 and 1997 indentures. In addition, the purchaser has obtained
commitments to make available a combination of facilities in order to support
the ongoing liquidity needs for the company.

The transaction is subject to the customary approvals, including CRTC approval
for the transfer of Bell's broadcast license, and Industry Canada with respect
to the transfer of spectrum licenses.

The transaction includes a break-up fee of C$800 million (US$751 million),
payable by BCE in certain circumstances and a reverse break-up fee of C$1
billion payable by the purchaser in certain circumstances. The transaction will
be completed through a plan of arrangement, which will require the approval of
two-thirds of outstanding common and preferred shares, voting as a class.
Shareholders will be asked to vote on the transaction at a special meeting, the
details of which will be announced in due course. The company anticipates that
the transaction will be completed in the first quarter of next year.

A proxy circular will be prepared and mailed to shareholders over the coming
months providing shareholders with important information about the transaction.
A material change report, which provides more details on the transaction, will
be filed with the Canadian securities commissions and with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission and will be available at www.sedar.com and at
www.sec.gov.

Legal advisors to BCE are Davies, Ward Phillips & Vineberg, Stikeman Elliott,
and Sullivan & Cromwell. The bid process was led by Goldman, Sachs and Co. BMO
Capital Markets, CIBC Capital Markets and RBC Capital Markets also acted as
financial advisors to the company. Greenhill and Co. provided independent
advice to the Strategic Oversight Committee of the BCE Board of Directors. The
Board received fairness opinions regarding the consideration to be paid for
common and preferred shares from the company's financial advisors.

Legal advisors to the investor group are Weil, Gotshal & Manges and Goodmans.
Citi is serving as lead mergers & acquisitions advisor to the consortium. Other
financial advisors include Deutsche Banc, Royal Bank of Scotland and TD
Securities.

Business Wire

DALLAS & BONN, Germany -- March 20, 2011

AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) and Deutsche Telekom AG (FWB: DTE) today announced that
they have entered into a definitive agreement under which AT&T will acquire
T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom in a cash-and-stock transaction currently
valued at approximately $39 billion. The agreement has been approved by the
Boards of Directors of both companies.

AT&Ts acquisition of T-Mobile USA provides an optimal combination of network
assets to add capacity sooner than any alternative, and it provides an
opportunity to improve network quality in the near term for both companies
customers. In addition, it provides a fast, efficient and certain solution to
the impending exhaustion of wireless spectrum in some markets, which limits
both companies ability to meet the ongoing explosive demand for mobile
broadband.

With this transaction, AT&T commits to a significant expansion of robust 4G
LTE (Long Term Evolution) deployment to 95 percent of the U.S. population to
reach an additional 46.5 million Americans beyond current plans  including
rural communities and small towns. This helps achieve the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) and President Obamas goals to connect every
part of America to the digital age. T-Mobile USA does not have a clear path
to delivering LTE.

This transaction represents a major commitment to strengthen and expand
critical infrastructure for our nations future, said Randall Stephenson,
AT&T Chairman and CEO. It will improve network quality, and it will bring
advanced LTE capabilities to more than 294 million people. Mobile broadband
networks drive economic opportunity everywhere, and they enable the expanding
high-tech ecosystem that includes device makers, cloud and content providers,
app developers, customers, and more. During the past few years, Americas
high-tech industry has delivered innovation at unprecedented speed, and this
combination will accelerate its continued growth.

Stephenson continued, This transaction delivers significant customer,
shareowner and public benefits that are available at this level only from the
combination of these two companies with complementary network technologies,
spectrum positions and operations. We are confident in our ability to execute
a seamless integration, and with additional spectrum and network capabilities,
we can better meet our customers current demands, build for the future and
help achieve the Presidents goals for a high-speed, wirelessly connected
America.

Deutsche Telekom Chairman and CEO René Obermann said, After evaluating
strategic options for T-Mobile USA, I am confident that AT&T is the best
partner for our customers, shareholders and the mobile broadband ecosystem.
Our common network technology makes this a logical combination and provides an
efficient path to gaining the spectrum and network assets needed to provide
T-Mobile customers with 4G LTE and the best devices. Also, the transaction
returns significant value to Deutsche Telekom shareholders and allows us to
retain exposure to the U.S. market.

As part of the transaction, Deutsche Telekom will receive an equity stake in
AT&T that, based on the terms of the agreement, would give Deutsche Telekom an
ownership interest in AT&T of approximately 8 percent. A Deutsche Telekom
representative will join the AT&T Board of Directors.

Competition and Pricing

The U.S. wireless industry is one of the most fiercely competitive markets in
the world and will remain so after this deal. The U.S. is one of the few
countries in the world where a large majority of consumers can choose from
five or more wireless providers in their local market. For example, in 18 of
the top 20 U.S. local markets, there are five or more providers. Local market
competition is escalating among larger carriers, low-cost carriers and several
regional wireless players with nationwide service plans. This intense
competition is only increasing with the build-out of new 4G networks and the
emergence of new market entrants.

The competitiveness of the market has directly benefited consumers. A 2010
report from the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) states the overall
average price (adjusted for inflation) for wireless services declined 50
percent from 1999 to 2009, during a period which saw five major wireless
mergers.

Addresses wireless spectrum challenges facing AT&T, T-Mobile USA, their
customers, and U.S. policymakers

This transaction quickly provides the spectrum and network efficiencies
necessary for AT&T to address impending spectrum exhaust in key markets driven
by the exponential growth in mobile broadband traffic on its network. AT&Ts
mobile data traffic grew 8,000 percent over the past four years and by 2015 it
is expected to be eight to 10 times what it was in 2010. Put another way, all
of the mobile traffic volume AT&T carried during 2010 is estimated to be
carried in just the first six to seven weeks of 2015. Because AT&T has led the
U.S. in smartphones, tablets and e-readers  and as a result, mobile broadband
 it requires additional spectrum before new spectrum will become available.
In the long term, the entire industry will need additional spectrum to address
the explosive growth in demand for mobile broadband.

Improves service quality for U.S. wireless customers

AT&T and T-Mobile USA customers will see service improvements - including
improved voice quality - as a result of additional spectrum, increased cell
tower density and broader network infrastructure. At closing, AT&T will
immediately gain cell sites equivalent to what would have taken on average
five years to build without the transaction, and double that in some markets.
The combination will increase AT&Ts network density by approximately 30
percent in some of its most populated areas, while avoiding the need to
construct additional cell towers. This transaction will increase spectrum
efficiency to increase capacity and output, which not only improves service,
but is also the best way to ensure competitive prices and services in a market
where demand is extremely high and spectrum is in short supply.

Expands 4G LTE deployment to 95 percent of U.S. population  urban and rural
areas

This transaction will directly benefit an additional 46.5 million Americans 
equivalent to the combined populations of the states of New York and Texas 
who will, as a result of this combination, have access to AT&Ts latest 4G LTE
technology. In terms of area covered, the transaction enables 4G LTE
deployment to an additional 1.2 million square miles, equivalent to 4.5 times
the size of the state of Texas. Rural and smaller communities will
substantially benefit from the expansion of 4G LTE deployment, increasing the
competitiveness of the businesses and entrepreneurs in these areas.

Increases AT&Ts investment in the U.S.

The acquisition will increase AT&Ts infrastructure investment in the U.S. by
more than $8 billion over seven years. Expansion of AT&Ts 4G LTE network is
an important foundation for the next wave of innovation and growth in mobile
broadband, ensuring the U.S. continues to lead the world in wireless
technology and availability. It makes T-Mobile USA, currently a German-owned
U.S. telecom network, part of a U.S.-based company.

An impressive, combined workforce

Bringing AT&T and T-Mobile USA together will create an impressive workforce
that is best positioned to compete in todays global economy. Post-closing,
AT&T intends to tap into the significant knowledge and expertise held by
employees of both AT&T and T-Mobile USA to succeed. AT&T is the only major
U.S. wireless company with a union workforce, offering leading wages,
benefits, training and development for employees. The combined company will
continue to have a strong employee and operations base in the Seattle area.

Consistent with AT&Ts track record of value-enhancing acquisitions

AT&T has a strong track record of executing value-enhancing acquisitions and
expects to create substantial value for shareholders through large,
straightforward synergies with a run rate of more than $3 billion, three years
after closing onward (excluding integration costs). The value of the synergies
is expected to exceed the purchase price of $39 billion. Revenue synergies
come from opportunities to increase smartphone penetration and data average
revenue per user, with cost savings coming from network efficiencies,
subscriber and support savings, reduced churn and avoided capital and spectrum
expenditures.

The transaction will enhance margin potential and improve the companys
long-term revenue growth potential as it benefits from a more robust mobile
broadband platform for new services.

Additional financial information

The $39 billion purchase price will include a cash payment of $25 billion with
the balance to be paid using AT&T common stock, subject to adjustment. AT&T
has the right to increase the cash portion of the purchase price by up to $4.2
billion with a corresponding reduction in the stock component, so long as
Deutsche Telekom receives at least a 5 percent equity ownership interest in
AT&T.

The number of AT&T shares issued will be based on the AT&T share price during
the 30-day period prior to closing, subject to a 7.5 percent collar; there is
a one-year lock-up period during which Deutsche Telekom cannot sell shares.

The cash portion of the purchase price will be financed with new debt and cash
on AT&Ts balance sheet. AT&T has an 18-month commitment for a one-year
unsecured bridge term facility underwritten by J.P. Morgan for $20 billion.
AT&T assumes no debt from T-Mobile USA or Deutsche Telekom and continues to
have a strong balance sheet.

The transaction is expected to be earnings (excluding non-cash amortization
and integration costs) accretive in the third year after closing. Pro-forma
for 2010, this transaction increases AT&Ts total wireless revenues from $58.5
billion to nearly $80 billion, and increases the percentage of AT&Ts total
revenues from wireless, wireline data and managed services to approximately 80
percent.

This transaction will allow for sufficient cash flow to support AT&Ts
dividend. AT&T has increased its dividend for 27 consecutive years, a matter
decided by AT&Ts Board of Directors.

Conditions

The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals, a reverse breakup fee in
certain circumstances, and other customary regulatory and other closing
conditions. The transaction is expected to close in approximately 12 months.

Advisors

Greenhill & Co., J.P. Morgan and Evercore Partners acted as financial advisors
and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, Arnold & Porter, and Crowell & Moring provided
legal advice to AT&T.

Business Wire

ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- April 15, 2013

DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ: DISH) today announced that it has submitted
a merger proposal to the Board of Directors of Sprint Nextel Corporation
(NYSE: S) for a total cash and stock consideration of $25.5 billion. The DISH
proposal clearly represents superior value to Sprint shareholders, including
greater ownership in a combined company that is better positioned for the
future with more spectrum, products, subscribers, financial scale and new
opportunities.

DISH is offering Sprint shareholders a total consideration of $25.5 billion,
consisting of $17.3 billion in cash and $8.2 billion in stock. Sprint
shareholders would receive $7.00 per share, based upon DISHs closing price on
Friday, April 12, 2013. This consists of $4.76 per share in cash and 0.05953
DISH shares per Sprint share. The cash portion of DISHs proposal represents
an 18% premium over the $4.03 per share implied by the SoftBank proposal, and
the equity portion represents approximately 32% ownership in the combined
DISH/Sprint versus SoftBanks proposal of a 30% interest in Sprint alone.
Together this represents a 13% premium to the value of the existing SoftBank
proposal.

The DISH proposal clearly presents Sprint shareholders with a superior
alternative to the pending SoftBank proposal, said Charlie Ergen, Chairman of
DISH Network. Sprint shareholders will benefit from a higher price with more
cash while also creating the opportunity to participate more meaningfully in a
combined DISH/Sprint with a significantly-enhanced strategic position and
substantial synergies that are not attainable through the pending SoftBank
proposal.

Mr. Ergen continued, A transformative DISH/Sprint merger will create the only
company that can offer customers a convenient, fully-integrated, nationwide
bundle of in- and out-of-home video, broadband and voice services.
Additionally, the combined national footprints and scale will allow
DISH/Sprint to bring improved broadband services to millions of homes with
inferior or no access to competitive broadband services. This unique, combined
company will have a leadership position in video, data and voice and the
necessary broadband spectrum to provide customers with rich content
everywhere, all the time.

The proposed combination will result in synergies and growth opportunities
estimated at $37 billion in net present value, including an estimated $11
billion in cost savings.

DISH has provided additional information regarding the proposed merger via a
dedicated transaction microsite that can be accessed at
www.CompleteDishSolution.com.

Barclays is acting as financial advisor to DISH.

Following is text of the letter that DISH sent to Sprint Nextel Corp. Board of
Directors on April 15, 2013.

Board of Directors
Sprint Nextel Corporation
6200 Sprint Parkway
Overland Park, KS 66251
Attn: James H. Hance, Jr., Chairman of the Board

Dear Jim:

On behalf of DISH Network Corporation (DISH), I am submitting this proposal
for a merger between DISH and Sprint Nextel Corporation (Sprint). Our
proposal provides Sprint shareholders with a superior alternative to the
pending SoftBank Corporation (SoftBank) proposal. It provides more cash and
affords your shareholders the opportunity to participate more meaningfully in
a combined DISH/Sprint, which will benefit from a significantly enhanced
strategic position and substantial synergies that are not attainable through
the pending SoftBank proposal.

We are offering Sprint shareholders a total consideration of $25.5 billion,
consisting of $17.3 billion in cash and $8.2 billion in stock. Sprint
shareholders would receive $7.00 per share, based upon DISHs closing price on
Friday, April 12, 2013. This consists of $4.76 per share in cash and 0.05953
DISH shares per Sprint share. The cash portion of our proposal represents an
18% premium over the $4.03 per share implied by the SoftBank proposal, and the
equity portion represents approximately 32% ownership in the combined
DISH/Sprint versus SoftBanks proposal of a 30% interest in Sprint alone.
Together this represents a 13% premium to the value of the existing SoftBank
proposal.

Our proposal provides a highly-compelling and unique opportunity for Sprint
shareholders. We are offering an ownership interest in a combined company with
a comprehensive product and services suite, a significantly enhanced
subscriber base, considerable financial and operating scale, as well as a
spectrum portfolio that would lead the industry. As a result, this merger
creates sizable cost and CAPEX savings and promises extensive new revenue
opportunities.

Leveraging both companies existing assets and expertise, we will be the only
company able to offer a fully-integrated, nationwide bundle of in- and
out-of-home video, broadband and voice services to meet rapidly evolving
customer preferences. The new companys assets will immediately establish
national cross-platform leadership and will position the company to deliver
innovative services while expanding our collective subscriber base.

The proposed combination will result in synergies and growth opportunities
estimated at $37 billion in net present value. This includes an estimated $11
billion in cost savings, representing approximately $1.8 billion in annual
run-rate cost synergies by the third year after closing.

Further, our combined national footprints and scale will allow us to
efficiently develop our joint spectrum assets to provide advanced services to
the millions of homes with inferior or no access to competitive broadband
services.

I am proud of the company we have built and believe we will be an excellent
partner to Sprint. Like Sprint, DISH possesses a strong tradition of
innovation and industry leadership. We created the third largest pay-TV
provider while competing with incumbent cable monopolies and other entrenched
operators. DISH has consistently led our industry in service and technology
delivery with award-winning innovations like Hopper® with Sling®. Our history
of value creation is outstanding. Investors in our 1995 initial public
offering have enjoyed a total return of 27 times their original investment,
significantly outperforming the broader markets and our peers. We also have a
proven track record of responsible capital management.

DISH has significant experience structuring and consummating strategic
transactions and only needs to complete confirmatory due diligence, which we
believe can be done quickly with your cooperation. We have examined your
merger agreement with SoftBank and we would be prepared to execute a
definitive merger agreement on substantially similar terms and conditions.
Though not a condition of our proposal, we anticipate that the pending
transaction with Clearwire would be completed. We are confident that we can
obtain all necessary approvals within a reasonable timeframe.

We intend to fund the $17.3 billion cash portion of the transaction using $8.2
billion of our balance sheet cash and additional debt financing. We have a
proven track record in raising capital to fund strategic initiatives and have
received a Highly Confident Letter from our financial advisor, Barclays,
confirming our ability to raise the required financing.

We would be pleased to discuss our plans for the combined company and we are
available at any time to meet with the Sprint Board, management and advisors
to answer any questions about our proposed merger. We are confident that the
Sprint Board will share our view that this proposed merger offers an excellent
opportunity for the equity holders of Sprint to realize a superior value for
their shares that is unavailable to them under the SoftBank proposal.

While it would have been our preference to have confidential discussions
regarding this proposed merger, your existing agreement with SoftBank and the
impending deadlines associated with your shareholder vote, will compel us to
confirm our intentions publicly. We look forward to hearing from you.

Very Truly Yours,

DISH Network Corporation

Charlie Ergen
Chairman

  Go-Shop Process

Business Wire

ROUND ROCK, Texas -- March 25, 2013

The Special Committee of the Board of Dell Inc. (NASDAQ: DELL) today announced
that the go-shop period provided for in the merger agreement between the
company and entities owned by Michael Dell, Dells Founder, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, and investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake Partners,
has elicited two alternative acquisition proposals. One proposal was submitted
by a group affiliated with a private equity fund managed by Blackstone and the
other by entities affiliated with Carl Icahn. Both proposals are attached.

The Special Committee, consisting of four independent and disinterested
directors, has determined, after consultation with its independent financial
and legal advisors, that both proposals could reasonably be expected to result
in superior proposals, as defined under the terms of the existing merger
agreement. Therefore, each of the Blackstone and Icahn groups is an excluded
party and the Special Committee intends to continue negotiations with both.

The Special Committee also noted that Michael Dell has confirmed to the
Committee his willingness to explore in good faith the possibility of working
with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals.

Alex Mandl, Chairman of the Special Committee, said, We are gratified by the
success of our go-shop process that has yielded two alternative proposals with
the potential to create additional value for Dell shareholders. We intend to
work diligently with all three potential acquirers to ensure the best possible
outcome for Dell shareholders, whichever transaction that may be.

Pursuant to the existing merger agreement, subject to certain requirements,
the Special Committee has the right to terminate the agreement in order to
accept a superior proposal. The Special Committee has not determined that
either the Blackstone proposal or the Icahn proposal in fact constitutes a
superior proposal under the existing merger agreement and neither is at this
stage sufficiently detailed or definitive for such a determination to be
appropriate. There can be no assurance that either proposal will ultimately
lead to a superior proposal. While negotiations continue, the Special
Committee has not changed its recommendation with respect to, and continues to
support, the company's pending sale to entities controlled by Michael Dell and
Silver Lake Partners.

Prior to entering into the existing merger agreement, the Special Committee
undertook a rigorous process, over a period of more than five months, to
evaluate Dells risks, opportunities, and strategic alternatives. These
alternatives included continuing with or modifying the companys existing
business plan, implementing a leveraged recapitalization, changing the
dividend policy, and potentially selling all or parts of the business.

As a result of that process, the Special Committee unanimously determined that
the sale of the company at a premium would be the best alternative for
stockholders, and negotiated aggressively to ensure that stockholders receive
the highest possible value, including securing provisions for a robust
go-shop process. The result was that a number of strategic and financial
parties entered into confidentiality agreements with the company and
Blackstone and Icahn submitted proposals.

The price of $13.65 per share in cash to be paid pursuant to the existing
merger agreement provides value certainty at a 37% premium to the average
price for the 90 days before rumors of the transaction surfaced. The Committee
noted that the Silver Lake Partners raised its bid six times by a total of
approximately $4 billion, or over 20%, during the course of negotiations.

Subject to applicable laws and regulations, the Special Committee undertakes
no obligation, to provide updates or make further statements regarding the
proposals received from Blackstone or Icahn, any revised proposals that may be
received from either of them or the status of discussions with either of them,
unless and until a definitive agreement is reached or such discussions are
terminated.

The alternative acquisition proposals received from Blackstone and Icahn
follow here:

                  c/o Blackstone Management Partners L.L.C.

                                                                March 22, 2013

STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Dell Inc.
One Dell Way
Round Rock, Texas 78682
Attention: Alex Mandl, Presiding Director
 
Re: Acquisition Proposal and Request for Designation as Excluded Party
 
 

Dear Mr. Mandl:

On behalf of Boulder Acquisition Corp. (AcquisitionCo), Blackstone
Management Associates VI L.L.C. (in its capacity as general partner of
Blackstone Capital Partners VI L.P.), Francisco Partners III, LP, Insight
Venture Management, LLC and each of their respective affiliates, affiliated
funds and limited partners (all such persons and entities, together with
AcquisitionCo, being collectively referred to herein as the Investor Group),
we hereby submit this Acquisition Proposal and request prompt designation of
the Investor Group as an Excluded Party, as such terms are defined in the
Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Dell Inc., a Delaware corporation
(Dell), and the Parent Parties (as defined therein) dated as of February 5,
2013 (the Merger Agreement).

Thank you for allowing us the access to management and data that we needed to
complete a preliminary review of the Dell business. We believe there is
significant upside in the Dell businesses, we see significant upside in the
value of Dells shares, and our proposed transaction structure (described
below) will deliver significantly greater value to your shareholders than the
value agreed to in the Merger Agreement.

As a result, we would like to proceed in the process to acquire Dell and
hereby submit, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, this
Acquisition Proposal. Subject to confirmatory due diligence and negotiation of
a mutually agreeable merger agreement (which we expect to include
substantially similar terms and conditions as the Merger Agreement, other than
certain changes to mechanical provisions required to implement the structure
of our Acquisition Proposal as described below), we are prepared to enter into
a definitive agreement to acquire Dell in a leveraged recapitalization
transaction where shareholders could choose to receive either all cash or
stock (subject to a cap), in each case valued in excess of $14.25 per share,
representing a Superior Proposal to the $13.65 cash purchase price agreed to
in the Merger Agreement.

We are prepared to invest the time and resources necessary to complete a
transaction along an expedited timeline, and we would contemplate providing
drafts of a definitive transaction agreement (which will include financing
commitment letters), along with our more detailed proposal as soon as possible
following the completion of satisfactory due diligence.

KEY FEATURES OF OUR PROPOSAL

Our Acquisition Proposal contemplates a leveraged recapitalization transaction
with the following features:

  * Shareholders who wish to receive cash will have the opportunity to receive
    greater than $14.25 in cash per share for all of their shares.
  * Shareholders who wish to participate in the ongoing upside of the company
    will have the opportunity to remain as shareholders and receive shares
    (subject to a cap) valued in excess of $14.25, which shares would continue
    to be publicly traded on the Nasdaq.

Our proposed transaction would have several important benefits for Dell
shareholders:

  * Higher price per share for shareholders electing to receive cash
  * Shareholder friendly structure, with the ability to choose cash or stock
  * Leveraged upside for shareholders who elect to remain as shareholders

FINANCING

We intend to fund the transaction using a combination of equity and debt
financing, in addition to Company cash and cash equivalents. We plan to invest
equity amounts in excess of those new equity amounts contemplated by the
Merger Agreement to facilitate the proposed transaction.

Based on discussions with equity co-investors, certain strategic partners, and
debt financing sources, we are highly confident that financing can be
arranged, which will include comparable debt sources and structures as the
existing deal. We are currently working with Morgan Stanley & Co LLC (Morgan
Stanley) as our lead debt financing source to prepare financing, and have had
discussions with other debt financing sources that have indicated a strong
interest to finance our Acquisition Proposal. We have received from Morgan
Stanley a highly confident letter related to our ability to raise the
required debt financing for this transaction. Upon designation of the Investor
Group as an Excluded Party we expect to finalize discussions with other
financing sources on an expedited basis. Additionally, at the time of
execution of definitive agreements with respect to our proposal, we expect to
provide binding financing commitments from debt and equity financing sources
in the form customary for a transaction of this type.

We have held discussions with some of Dells largest shareholders, and we
anticipate inviting them, certain of Dells other shareholders and certain
other strategic and financial partners to participate in the transaction as
part of our group. We would also expect to encourage (but would not require)
the MD Investors (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to participate in our
transaction by rolling over equity held by the MD Investors.

TIMING

We have significant experience structuring and consummating transactions of
this nature, and we believe we can complete our due diligence review and
negotiate the terms and conditions of a Superior Proposal (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) quickly during the next phase of the process. Given our due
diligence to date, we anticipate that the remaining due diligence would focus
on key business, accounting, legal and regulatory matters and could be
completed quickly, assuming full cooperation of Dell and its advisors. As part
of this process, we would expect to have full access to the senior management
team of Dell, certain other key employees, Dells independent accountants and
Dells records, financial and operating data and material agreements
(including the schedules attached to the Merger Agreement).

We are committed to continuing to pursue a transaction on the terms herein,
which we believe will provide a more compelling value proposition to Dell and
its shareholders than currently provided under the Merger Agreement. We
believe that this proposal meets all applicable requirements under the Merger
Agreement to enable the Special Committee to determine that the Investor Group
is an Excluded Party in accordance with the Merger Agreement. Due to the
considerable time commitment and uncertainty of outcome, we will continue our
due diligence and work toward providing a definitive proposal, only upon
receipt of written confirmation from the Special Committee of the Board of
Directors that the Investor Group has been determined to be an Excluded Party
in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

GENERAL

The proposal contained in this letter constitutes an indication of our
interest in pursuing a transaction and does not constitute a binding offer,
agreement or agreement to proceed with the transaction or to otherwise make a
binding offer or agreement at any point in the future.

This indication of interest is submitted by us for review and consideration by
the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Dell on a confidential
basis, and the existence of our discussions and this letter (other than such
disclosure obligations outlined in the Merger Agreement) shall be kept
strictly confidential in accordance with the terms of that certain letter
agreement by and between Blackstone Management Partners L.L.C. and Dell, dated
February 22, 2013.

This letter shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of law principles
thereof.

This proposal will expire at 5:00pm (NY time) on March 28 if you fail to
provide the written confirmation discussed above prior to such time.

Please do not hesitate to contact any of the team members listed below with
any questions.

Sincerely Yours,

Re: Acquisition Proposal for Dell Inc. (Dell)

Dear Members of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Dell and
Advisors:

On February 5, 2013, Dell entered into a merger agreement (the February 5
Merger Agreement) with certain entities affiliated with Silver Lake Partners
and Michael S. Dell. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this letter
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the February 5 Merger
Agreement. Section 5.3 of the February 5 Merger Agreement provides, among
other things, that Dell, its Subsidiaries and its Representatives have the
right to initiate, solicit, encourage and receive Acquisition Proposals with
respect to Dell up to the No-Shop Period Start Date. This Acquisition
Proposal, which is detailed below, is being delivered, as contemplated by the
February 5 Merger Agreement, by Icahn Enterprises LP, and Carl C. Icahn, prior
to the No-Shop Period Start Date.

Icahn Enterprises LP

We believe that you will agree that Icahn Enterprises is well able to provide
the $1 billion cash equity capital (in addition to its existing $1 billion
stock position in Dell), and that Mr. Icahn and his affiliates other than
Icahn Enterprises are well able to provide the additional $3 billion cash
equity capital, contemplated in this Acquisition Proposal, which constitutes
an aggregate $5 billion equity commitment. In this regard we invite you to
examine the public filings of Icahn Enterprises and to meet with us regarding
any additional questions you may have. Further, we have excellent relationship
with numerous large banking institutions and we are confident that we would be
able to obtain the debt financing contemplated in our proposal. Although we
are well known for the performance of our investment activities, over time we
have found that our greatest returns have come from the control and ownership
of portfolio companies. For example, in May 2012, Icahn Enterprises purchased
a controlling interest in CVR Energy, Inc. (CVR) for an aggregate purchase
price approximately $2 billion. As of March 11, 2013, based on the closing
sale price of CVR stock and distributions since Icahn Enterprises acquired
control, we had a gain of over $2 billion on our purchase of CVR.

Currently, the portfolio companies owned or controlled by Icahn Enterprises
and Mr. Icahn include among others, the following:

                                                 
                                                   
Name                                 Holdings     Date of Initial Investment
CVR Energy, Inc.                     82%          2011
Tropicana Entertainment Inc.         67%          2008
West Point Home                      100%         2004
Federal Mogul Corporation            78%          2001
Viskase Companies Inc.               70%          2001
XO Holdings                          100%         2001
PSC Metals                           100%         1998
American Railcar Industries Inc.     55%          1994
ACF Industries                       100%         1984
                                                   

The Acquisition Proposal For Dell

As you know, on March 10, 2013 Icahn Enterprises entered into a
confidentiality agreement with Dell and commenced due diligence in support of
an Acquisition Proposal. On March 13, 2013, Jefferies LLC (Jefferies), as a
representative of Icahn Enterprises, entered into a confidentiality agreement
with Dell and commenced due diligence in support of an Acquisition Proposal.
Further, on and after February 8, 2013, Southeastern Asset Management Inc.
(Southeastern) has publicly disclosed its desire to remain a shareholder of
Dell, rather than participate in the merger contemplated by the February 5
Merger Agreement and has suggested that the merger be recast as a transaction
under which Dell shareholders are provided with the opportunity to elect to
continue to hold Dell shares or receive cash, at their option. T. Rowe Price
has similarly opposed the February 5 Merger Agreement. For purposes of this
proposal, Icahn Enterprises assumes that Southeastern and T. Rowe Price and
other larger holders would, if provided the opportunity, support the proposal
set forth below and agree to the matters set forth in the fourth bullet item
of the proposal set forth below.

We hereby propose that we and Dell engage in the following merger transaction
(the Proposed Merger, and the surviving company of the Proposed Merger, the
Surviving Company):

  * Dell will obtain transaction funding composed of the following:

       * $2.0 billion investment ($1 billion by Icahn Enterprises and $1
         billion by Carl C. Icahn and his affiliates other than Icahn
         Enterprises) for the purchase of common shares of the Surviving
         Company (in addition to the shares currently owned by Icahn
         Enterprises and its affiliates) at a price of $15 per share,
         resulting in an additional 133 million shares being issued by the
         Surviving Company. As contemplated in the fifth bullet item below,
         Mr. Icahn and his affiliates other than Icahn Enterprises, are
         willing to commit an additional $2 billion of cash equity financing,
         for an aggregate $5 billion total equity commitment to this
         Acquisition Proposal.
       * $7.4 billion of cash currently available at Dell.
       * $1.712 billion in new factoring receivable facility (total factoring
         receivable facility of $3.0 billion).
       * $5.218 billion in new debt.
       * We understand that this Proposed Merger contemplates less total
         leverage on the Surviving Company than under the February 5 Merger
         Agreement.

  * In connection with the Proposed Merger, Dell shareholders will be entitled
    to elect to receive either: (x) shares of the Surviving Company on a
    one-to-one basis with their current holdings; or (y) an aggregate of up to
    $15.65 billion in cash (the Payment Funding) payable at a rate of $15
    per share. If the Payment Funding is fully utilized this would result in
    1.043 billion shares (58.1% of the current outstanding) being subject to
    the Proposed Merger. If shareholders electing to receive cash exceed the
    maximum number of shares that may be acquired with the Payment Funding,
    then such elections will be accepted on a pro rated basis. If electing
    shareholders are insufficient to utilize all of the Payment Funding, then
    the balance will be distributed to all of the remaining shareholders of
    the Surviving Company as a special dividend (the Special Dividend).
  * In addition to the Payment Funding, Icahn Enterprises anticipates that
    Dell would be required to pay the breakup fee under the February 5 Merger
    Agreement of $180 million, and that Dell would incur other deal fees and
    expenses in the Proposed Merger of approximately $500 million, for a
    maximum aggregate use of funds of approximately $16.33 billion.
  * Neither Icahn Enterprises (which together with its affiliates, currently
    owns approximately 80 million shares of Dell), Southeastern (which
    publicly reports ownership of approximately 146.5 million shares of Dell),
    T. Rowe Price (which publicly reports ownership of approximately 82
    million shares of Dell), nor other large holders that so agree
    (collectively with Icahn Enterprise, Southeastern, and T. Rowe Price, the
    Rollover Holders), would be eligible to elect to receive cash or shares
    in the Proposed Merger, but rather their existing common stock position in
    Dell would rollover into the Surviving Company. Rollover Holders would
    receive the Special Dividend, if any.
  * Pursuant to the Proposed Merger, if all eligible existing Dell
    shareholders elect to receive cash, then approximately 58.1% of the
    currently outstanding Dell shares would be subject to the Proposed Merger
    and following the completion of the Proposed Merger, Icahn Enterprises and
    its affiliates would own 24.1% of the outstanding shares of the Surviving
    Company; Southeastern and its affiliates would own 16.6% of the
    outstanding shares of the Surviving Company; T. Rowe Price and its
    affiliates would own 9.3% of the Surviving Company and the remaining
    public shareholders would own 50% of the shares of the Surviving Company.
    The opportunity exists to increase the number of shares cashed out by
    non-Rollover Holders in the Proposed Merger, if the large holders agree
    with Icahn Enterprises to become Rollover Holders. Further, Mr. Icahn and
    his affiliates other than Icahn Enterprises would be willing to commit (in
    addition to the equity investment provided for in the first bullet item
    above) an additional $2 billion of equity capital in cash, in the event
    that Southeastern, T. Rowe Price or other existing large Dell shareholders
    do not agree to become Rollover Holders.
  * Closing is anticipated to occur in July 2013.

This proposal contemplates the negotiation, execution and delivery of a
definitive agreement (the Definitive Agreement) containing the terms and
conditions set forth herein, together with covenants, representations,
warranties and indemnification provisions which are satisfactory to both
parties (including, if so requested, limits on the election of merger
consideration) and which are typical and standard in a transaction of this
nature.

This letter is a non-binding proposal. Neither Icahn Enterprises, Mr. Icahn,
their respective affiliates, officers or directors or representatives, have,
nor will this proposal letter or any discussions or communications among the
parties, create or constitute, any offer, obligation, contract, commitment or
duty of any kind or character, to engage in, negotiate or enter into or
complete a transaction. Only a Definitive Agreement executed and delivered by
the parties thereto, shall be binding upon the parties.

We look forward to proceeding with negotiations as promptly as possible and
are prepared, together with Jefferies, to commit the resources to develop a
Definitive Agreement with you. In addition, we look forward to receiving your
confirmation that the Special Committee has concluded that our proposal is or
could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal.

Very truly yours,

Sallie Mae Accepts $25 Billion Bid From Funds, Banks (Update8)


     (Adds Kennedy comments in last two paragraphs.)

By James M. O'Neill and Brian K. Sullivan
     April 16 (Bloomberg) -- SLM Corp. accepted a $25 billion
buyout offer from a group led by J.C. Flowers & Co., a
transaction that would take private the largest U.S. provider of
student loans.
     Flowers, together with Friedman Fleischer & Lowe LLC,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp., offered $60 a
share for SLM, known as Sallie Mae. The price is 28 percent more
than the stock's $46.76 closing value on April 13. The record
high was $58.12 in January 2006.
     Demand for private education loans has surged an average of
27 percent each of the last six years as more students borrow to
attend the 4,200 American universities, from Harvard to Kansas
State. Sallie Mae agreed last week to pay $2 million and adopt a
new code of conduct in a settlement with New York Attorney
General Andrew Cuomo, who is probing deceptive loan practices.
     ``There's a lot of potential value, and there's scope for
consolidation as well'' in the student-loan industry, said Lucy
MacDonald, chief investment officer at RCM Ltd. in London, which
oversees $100 billion and doesn't own any SLM shares.
     Students at U.S. colleges borrow an estimated $85 billion a
year to finance school costs, and the loans are considered safe
because of government guarantees. Between 1989 and 2005, the cost
of a college education increased an average 6 percent, double the
overall 3 percent inflation rate, according to the College Board.

                         First Marblehead

     Shares of Sallie Mae, based in Reston, Virginia, jumped
$8.29, or 18 percent, to close at $55.05 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Today's increase beat the one-day
record of 15 percent on April 13, after the New York Times said
the company may be acquired.
     The transaction will help the banks at the expense of
financial services companies that specialize in student loans,
analysts said. Shares of First Marblehead Corp., the third-
biggest company securitizing student loans, lost more than a
fifth of their value, falling $9.83 to $34.60 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
     By using Sallie Mae, the biggest company packaging student
loans into securities, JPMorgan and Bank of America may be able
to avoid paying fees to First Marblehead for the service after
existing contracts expire, said Sameer Gokhale, a New York-based
analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in an interview.

                      Marketing Other Offers

     First Marblehead gets about 41 percent of its loans through
JPMorgan and Bank of America, said Thomas Weisel Partners Group
Inc. analyst Mark Sproule in a note to investors.
     An additional benefit for the banks, Gokhale said, is that
they may be able to ``cross-sell their other products to the
student customers they get through Sallie Mae, selling credit
cards, mortgages and the like.''
     While the deal is good for stockholders, after the shares
lost 30 percent from January 2006 to last week, it is bad for
bondholders. The $16.2 billion in debt incurred in the sale will
probably push the company's bond rating down, forcing many
investors to sell.
     ``Bondholders feel burned,'' said David S. Hochstim, an
analyst with Bear Stearns Cos. in New York. ``A lot of investors
manage their bond holdings based on the rating, so it's a mess
for them.''
     Moody's Investors Service said it may cut Sallie Mae's A2
credit rating by ``multiple'' levels, ``potentially to
speculative grade.'' Fitch Ratings downgraded SLM's short-term
rating to F1 from F1+, and placed all of SLM's ratings on
negative rating watch. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services put
SLM's long-term A credit rating on watch for a downgrade.

                          Perceived Risk

    The perceived risk of owning Sallie Mae's bonds surged.
Credit-default swaps based on $10 million of the company's debt
rose by about $69,000 to $157,000 at the close of trading in New
York, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. The price of
the contracts, used to speculate on the company's ability to
repay debt, has more than quadrupled from $36,500 on April 12.
     The price of the credit-default swaps suggests investors
expect the company may retain an investment-grade rating. It
costs about $200,000 a year for five years to protect the debt of
companies rated BB, or two levels below investment grade, from
default with credit derivatives, according to New York-based bond
research firm CreditSights Inc.
     The buyout group may use asset-backed bonds instead of
unsecured debt to finance the purchase, analysts at CreditSights
said in a report yesterday. Asset-backed debt typically has
higher ratings than unsecured securities.
     The private equity funds plan to take 50.2 percent of SLM,
investing $4.4 billion. JPMorgan and Bank of America will each
own 24.9 percent, putting up $2.2 billion each, according to
today's statement.

                          Flowers' Vision

     J. Christopher Flowers, head of the firm that bears his
name, was attracted to Sallie Mae because of the growth in
student lending, he said in an interview with the Wall Street
Journal. Teaming up with the banks secures financing that will
allow Sallie Mae to expand at a faster pace, and the company's
strong cash flow will help the buyers pay down debt, the paper
said, citing Flowers.
     Flowers, a former general partner at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., helped lead a takeover of Japan's Shinsei Bank Ltd.,
formerly known as Long Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. A
subsequent initial public offering in 2004 and a share offering
in 2005 contributed to profits of as much as $7 billion for
investors.
     Sallie Mae raises money by issuing bonds to investors. The
company then uses the funds to make loans to students. SLM pays
bondholders back and earns profit from the principal and interest
payments that students make on their loans. Sallie Mae also pools
existing loans to create asset-backed securities, which it then
offers to investors, raising more funds for lending.

                          Diversification

     A decade ago, Sallie Mae's entire revenue base consisted of
guaranteed student loans. In the past 10 years, the company has
diversified into college-savings plans and private student loans.
Guaranteed borrowings now make up 40 percent of revenue, with
private student lending accounting for 23 percent, Joyce said.
     The buyout agreement demonstrates the profitability of
student lending and the need for more oversight, U.S. Senator
Edward Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the U.S.
Senate's education committee, said in a statement.
     ``The key question is not what this deal means for investors
on Wall Street, but what it means for the millions of students
and families on Main Street who rely on student loans to get
through college,'' he said.

  Exelon Corporation Offers to Acquire NRG Energy, Inc. in $6.2 Billion
  Transaction

Business Wire

CHICAGO -- October 20, 2008

Exelon Corporation (NYSE:EXC) today announced its proposal to acquire
Princeton, N.J.-based NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG). Exelon has offered to
acquire all of the outstanding NRG common stock in an all-stock transaction
with a fixed exchange ratio with a value of $26.43 for each NRG common share,
representing a total equity value of approximately $6.2 billion for NRG based
on Exelons closing price on October 17.

In a letter delivered today to NRG President and CEO David Crane and Chairman
Howard Cosgrove, Exelon proposed to acquire all of NRGs outstanding common
stock in an all-stock transaction with a fixed exchange ratio of 0.485 Exelon
shares for each NRG share, which represents a value of approximately $26.43
for each NRG common share, based on the Exelon closing price of $54.50 in
trading on October 17, 2008. The offer represents a 37% premium to the October
17 closing price for NRG shares.

In the all-stock transaction, which is intended to be tax-free, NRG common
shareholders would exchange their stock for Exelon stock, which would provide
NRG shareholders the opportunity to participate in the future growth of the
largest and most diversified power company in the nation with a substantially
improved credit profile.

An Exelon-NRG combination would result in a total enterprise value of
approximately $60 billion with a generating capacity of around 47,000
megawatts, or enough electricity to serve nearly 45 million homes, said John
W. Rowe, Chairman and CEO of Exelon. This combination would not only
diversify Exelons generation portfolio geographically, it would also create
immediate earnings and cash flow accretion. We believe a combination of Exelon
and NRG would represent an exceptional value for shareholders of both
companies.

Strategic Benefits of a Combined Exelon-NRG

  * Enhanced Scope and Scale  The combined company would constitute the
    largest power company in the U.S., with sufficient financial and operating
    strength to address the nations increasingly urgent energy needs. The
    combined company would have an enterprise value of approximately $60
    billion and a market capitalization of $40 billion.
  * Increased Generation Efficiency  Significant efficiencies of scale would
    be realized from the combination of Exelon and NRG. The combined companys
    approximately 47,000 MW fleet (after giving effect to planned divestitures
    associated with regulatory approvals) would include 18,000 MW of nuclear
    generation.
  * Unparalleled Fuel and Geographic Diversification  The combined company
    would have a more highly diversified mix of generation capacity with a
    presence in four major domestic competitive power generation regions and a
    diversified fuel mix using uranium, natural gas, coal and oil.
  * Financial Strength  NRG is highly leveraged with over $8 billion of debt
    and a credit rating of Ba3/B+. The combination of Exelon and NRG will
    reduce the leverage associated with NRGs current business and enhance its
    credit rating. Although the combination is expected to reduce Exelons
    credit ratings, Exelon is committed to a path to restore the ratings of
    the combined company to Exelons current ratings.
  * Stock Appreciation Potential  The anticipated earnings and cash flow
    accretion, and the resulting strong balance sheet, offer shareholders of
    the combined company greater potential for stock appreciation.
  * Stock Liquidity  With the largest market capitalization in the industry,
    and an exceptional record of growth over the past seven years, Exelon
    stock represents a more liquid investment for NRG shareholders and a more
    solid track record of value return for its shareholders.
  * Substantial Synergies  The combined company would realize substantial
    efficiencies through the combination of solid operational, financial and
    service capabilities. Based on a preliminary analysis of publicly
    available information, Exelon expects the proposed transaction to be
    accretive to earnings and cash flow in the first full calendar year of
    operations of the combined company, before giving effect to purchase
    accounting and other adjustments that may result from due diligence
    investigation.

Mr. Rowe added, We would welcome the opportunity to sit down with NRGs CEO
and board of directors and to move forward quickly with this significant
opportunity for value creation on all fronts.

Exelons Letter to NRG

The full text of the letter sent on October 19 to David Crane, President and
CEO of NRG, is reprinted below.

October 19, 2008

Mr. David Crane

President and Chief Executive Officer

NRG Energy, Inc.

211 Carnegie Center

Princeton, New Jersey 08540

Dear David:

Thank you for meeting with Chris Crane and me on September 30. I believe we
had a productive discussion about our respective companies, the challenges we
face in this difficult economic environment, and the potential strengths a
combination of NRG and Exelon would create.

A merger of NRG and Exelon would address critical national energy needs in a
highly effective fashion, while creating substantially more value for both
companies shareholders than either company can realize alone:

  * The combined company would constitute the largest U.S. power company in
    terms of assets, market capitalization, enterprise value and generating
    capacity. The approximately 47,000 MW fleet (after giving effect to
    planned divestitures) would include 18,000 MW of nuclear generation.
  * The combined company would have best-in-class nuclear and fossil
    operations with the second lowest carbon emitting intensity in the
    industry, positioning it to address the challenges of a carbon constrained
    world.
  * The resulting companys balance sheet would be very strong, with
    investment grade credit ratings, providing greater flexibility for growth
    and hedging while also reducing the cost of capital.
  * Fuel and geographic diversity would be unparalleled, with a presence in
    four major power regions, using uranium, natural gas, coal and oil.
  * A merged company will realize substantial synergies through the
    combination of solid operational, financial and service capabilities.

Since our meeting, we have evaluated all of these factors in greater detail
and continue to believe our initial assessment of the advantages a combination
would bring both companies is well founded. To that end, with the unanimous
authorization of our Board of Directors, I am writing on behalf of Exelon to
submit a proposal for a business combination of Exelon and NRG. Under our
proposal, Exelon would acquire all of the outstanding shares of NRG common
stock at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.485 Exelon shares for each NRG common
share. Our offer represents a 37 percent premium to NRG shareholders above
NRGs closing price on October 17, 2008. Exelon will also appropriately
address the interests of the holders of NRG preferred stock.

I know that you are committed to realizing the upside potential embedded in
NRGs stock, which we agree is not fully reflected in its current stock price.
We believe our proposal fully addresses that concern. In addition to a 37
percent premium, the exchange would give NRG shareholders the full upside
potential of Exelon, the preeminent company in our industry. That potential is
predicated on our consistent leadership in productivity and efficiency and the
strength of our carbon position; ownership of seventeen world class nuclear
units, the most valuable assets in our industry; a growth pattern in the last
eight years unparalleled in the industry; and a balance sheet and liquidity of
exceptional strength and value, notwithstanding the recent economic downturn.

Our proposal is subject to the negotiation of a definitive merger agreement
and receipt of the necessary board and shareholder approvals. Because our
proposal is based solely on publicly available information, it is also subject
to our having the opportunity to conduct limited confirmatory due diligence.
In addition, because the merger consideration is payable in Exelon stock,
Exelon would provide NRG with an opportunity to conduct appropriate due
diligence with respect to Exelon. We are prepared to begin discussions and due
diligence immediately.

Exelon understands that approvals of regulatory authorities may depend upon
modest divestiture of some assets of the combined company in some markets.
Exelon has developed a divestiture strategy that will address the concerns of
regulatory authorities, and we are confident that our proposed combination
will receive all necessary regulatory approvals.

Exelon also recognizes that a substantial amount of NRG debt may need to be
refinanced upon a change of control of NRG. Of course, both companies will
want to have assurances that it is feasible to refinance that debt before
closing the transaction. Based on discussions with our financial advisors, we
believe that we will be able to arrange for the refinancing of NRG debt and
appropriately address the NRG lien facility with trading counterparties, and
we will propose to include provisions in the definitive agreement to assure
both companies that the refinancing and lien facility arrangements are
completed at the closing of the combination.

We look forward to the opportunity to discuss our proposal with you and your
team. Due to the importance of this subject to the NRG board and the value
represented by Exelons proposal, we expect that the NRG board will engage in
a full review of our proposal. My team and I will make ourselves available to
meet with you and your board at your earliest convenience. Considering the
significance of this proposal to your shareholders and ours, Exelon intends to
publicly release the text of this letter immediately.

Sincerely yours,

John W. Rowe

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

NEWS RELEASE

15 June 2010

 NEWS CORPORATION PROPOSES TO THE BOARD OF BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC
A CASH OFFER OF 700 PENCE PER SHARE FOR THE BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC
                        SHARES IT DOES NOT ALREADY OWN

 

News Corporation  (""News Corp"")  announces  that it  approached the  Board  of
British Sky Broadcasting Group  plc (""BSkyB"") on Thursday,  10 June 2010,  and
proposed making an offer to acquire the  entire issued and to be issued  share
capital of BSkyB  not already  owned by  it for 675  pence in  cash per  share
subject to the conditions described in this announcement. 

 

After News  Corp  made  the  proposal,  the  Independent  Directors  of  BSkyB
requested that  News  Corp  enter  into  discussions  with  the  objective  of
achieving an  agreed proposal  for  the mutual  benefit of  all  shareholders.
 Following these discussions, News Corp increased the proposal to 700 pence in
cash per share (the ""Proposal"").

 

News Corp and  the BSkyB  Independent Directors have  been unable  to reach  a
mutually agreeable  price at  the current  time.  However,  both parties  have
agreed to work  together to proceed  with the regulatory  process in order  to
facilitate a proposed transaction  and, accordingly, we  have agreed to  enter
into a Cooperation Agreement, details of which are set out below.

 

News Corp has been a major shareholder in BSkyB for over twenty years and  has
had Board representation  throughout that  period.  News  Corp currently  owns
686,021,700 BSkyB shares, representing 39.1% of BSkyB's issued share capital.

 

Highlights of the Proposal

·      News Corp proposes  to the Independent Directors  of BSkyB an offer  of
700 pence in cash per share for the  shares in BSkyB that it does not  already
own.

·      The Proposal is at an attractive price and represents:

o  a premium of approximately 22.0% to BSkyB's share price of 574 pence at the
close of business on 9 June 2010, being the day prior to News Corp's  approach
to the BSkyB Board;

o   a  premium  of  approximately  27.5%  to  the  average  closing  price  of
approximately 549 pence for the twelve month period to 9 June 2010, being  the
day prior to News Corp's approach to the BSkyB Board; and

o  a multiple of  approximately 11.8 times  BSkyB's earnings before  interest,
tax, depreciation and  amortisation of £1,139  million (US$1,686 million)  for
the pro-forma twelve month period ended 31 March 2010.

·      The Proposal values the fully diluted share capital of BSkyB, excluding
the shares already owned by News Corp, at approximately £7.8 billion  (US$11.5
billion).

 

Chase Carey,  Deputy Chairman,  President and  Chief Operating  Officer,  News
Corp, commented:

""We are proud of the success BSkyB has achieved over the years and of the many
innovations it has brought to consumers  in the UK and Ireland.  That  success
is reflected in its  strong public market  valuation.  Our increased  proposal
represents both an attractive valuation at approximately 11.8 times EBITDA for
the twelve months to 31 March 2010 and a premium of 27.5% over BSkyB's average
share price for the last twelve months prior to our approach.

 

""We believe that this  is the right  time for BSkyB  to become a  wholly-owned
part of News Corporation with its greater scale and broader geographic  reach.
For News Corporation, our  Proposal presents an  opportunity to consolidate  a
core business  with  which  we  have been  closely  associated  for  over  two
decades.  News Corporation  will also benefit  from increasing the  geographic
diversification of  our  earnings  base, reducing  our  exposure  to  cyclical
advertising  revenues  and   increasing  our   direct  consumer   subscription
revenues. 

 

""However,  we  are  taking  a   disciplined  approach  to  this   transaction,
recognising both the market  valuation of BSkyB  and our substantial  existing
ownership.

 

""It goes without  saying that  we are a  committed shareholder  and are  fully
supportive of  the talented  management  team and  exceptional people  at  the
company.""

 

News Corp plans to finance its  proposed offer by using a significant  portion
of the available cash on its balance sheet plus borrowed funds.

IMPORTANT NOTICE

News Corp's Proposal is subject, inter alia, to the following pre-conditions:

·      clearance of the proposed transaction by the EC and any other  relevant
competition or regulatory authority; and

·      News Corp obtaining satisfactory financing.

News  Corp's  preliminary   assessment  suggests  that   the  thresholds   for
notification under the EC Merger Regulation  are met and, as a result,  merger
filings will be required.  Relevant documentation is expected to be filed with
anti-trust and other regulatory bodies as soon as possible.

Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, News Corp and the Independent Directors
of BSkyB have agreed:

 

·      to cooperate in obtaining all relevant competition and other regulatory
approvals. News Corp is not required  to agree to any undertaking,  commitment
or assurance in relation to any such approval.

 

·      a standstill under which News Corp will not (except with the  agreement
of the Independent Directors of BSkyB or in other specified circumstances):

 

o  until  the earlier  of two  months after  grant of  the merger  clearances,
payment of the  Break Fee described  below, and 31  December 2011, acquire  or
offer to acquire an interest in BSkyB shares  or make an offer for all or  any
part of the share  capital of BSkyB  or take action that  would require it  to
make any takeover or similar transaction involving the securities of BSkyB.

 

o  until the  earlier of  five months after  grant of  the merger  clearances,
payment  of  the  Break  Fee  described  below,  and  31  December  2011  (the
""Standstill Period""), make an offer for all  or any part of the share  capital
of BSkyB (other  than an  offer that  is conditional  upon News  Corp and  its
associates acquiring  shares carrying  70% or  more of  the voting  rights  of
BSkyB) or take action that  would require it to  make any takeover or  similar
transaction involving the securities of BSkyB.

 

·      that, until the earlier of the  payment of the Break Fee and expiry  of
the Standstill Period, BSkyB will not request that the Panel on Takeovers  and
Mergers (the  ""Panel"") imposes  a time  limit  for News  Corp to  clarify  its
intentions with regard to BSkyB  pursuant to Rule 2.4(b)  of the City Code  on
Takeovers and Mergers (the ""Takeover Code"").

 

·      News Corp will pay to BSkyB a break fee (the ""Break Fee"") equal to 0.5%
of the value  of an offer  were one to  have been made  at the Proposal  price
(approximately £38.5 million, or US$57.0 million) if:

 

o  certain  merger  control  and competition  clearances  are  unconditionally
granted or granted subject to agreement  to a non-material remedy prior to  31
December 2011; and

 

o  News Corp does not announce an  offer pursuant to Rule 2.5 of the  Takeover
Code at the Proposal price or such higher price that is permitted by the Panel
or such lower price that is agreed with the Independent Directors of BSkyB  (a
""Firm Offer Price"") within five months following such clearance; or

 

o  News Corp announces, prior to  the conclusion of the processes required  to
achieve all merger control and competition clearances, that it does not intend
to announce a firm offer at the Firm Offer Price or the Takeover Code  applies
in such a way as to restrict News Corp from doing so in any such case prior to
31 December 2011.

 

·      the Break Fee may be distributed to BSkyB shareholders other than  News
Corp and  its affiliates  if so  determined by  the Independent  Directors  of
BSkyB, and News Corp has  agreed to vote in favour  of any resolution to  give
that effect.

 

·      the Break Fee is not payable in the event that (i) BSkyB has  committed
a wilful  or  intentional  breach  of its  warranties  or  representations  or
obligations under the Cooperation Agreement, or (ii) a transaction is publicly
disclosed (including a possible offer from a third party) prior to 31 December
2011 which would be an alternative to, inconsistent with or reasonably  likely
to preclude News Corp from implementing  an acquisition of the whole of  BSkyB
and subsequently  becomes wholly  unconditional  (the ""Non-Pay  Events"").  The
standstill described above will  cease to apply in  the event BSkyB commits  a
wilful breach of the Cooperation Agreement that is not remedied.

This announcement is being made in accordance with Rule 2.4 of the City Code
on Takeovers and Mergers (the ""Code""). This announcement does not constitute

       PER SHARE IN CASH TO CAPITAL SHOPPING CENTRES GROUP PLC (""CSC"")

 

Simon announces that it has today sent a letter, the text of which is set  out
below, to the Board of  CSC.  The letter contains  the terms of an  indicative
proposal of  425  pence per  share  in cash  for  the shares  of  CSC's  other
shareholders.

The letter does not constitute an announcement of a firm intention to make  an
offer under Rule 2.5 of  the Code.  There can be  no certainty that any  offer

LETTER TO THE BOARD OF CSC

 

December 15, 2010

The Board of Directors
Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC
40 Broadway
London
SW1H 0BT

Dear Sirs/Madam,

Indicative offer for Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC (""CSC"")

I am writing  to propose  a transaction in  which Simon  Property Group,  Inc.
(""Simon"") would offer CSC's other shareholders 425 pence in cash per  ordinary
share.

Our interest in making  an offer for  CSC is, of course,  not new.  By  making
this offer on the terms outlined in this letter, we are confident that we have
now answered any objections you have previously expressed.  We believe that we
should work together to  announce a recommended offer,  and would urge you  to
listen to calls  from your shareholders  - many of  whom we have  spoken to  -
opposing the  Trafford  Centre  transaction  or asking  you  to  adjourn  your
forthcoming EGM.

Benefits of our proposal

We believe that our proposal provides a full and fair premium valuation to CSC
shareholders.  A cash offer of 425 pence per CSC share would represent:

·    a premium of 26%  to CSC's closing share  price of 337 pence  immediately
prior to the commencement of the offer period on November 24, 2010;

·    a premium of 21%  to CSC's average daily closing  price over the 6  month
period prior to commencement of the offer period on November 24, 2010;

·    a premium of 16% to the blended share price of 367 pence at which CSC  is
proposing to issue 25% of the company's shares to Peel to fund the acquisition
of the Trafford Centre;

·    a premium  of 13%  to CSC's  diluted NAV  per share  of 377  pence as  of
November 1, 2010; and

·    a premium of 7% to CSC's closing share price of 396 pence on December 14,
2010, the day before the date of this letter.

Financing

Simon  is  an  S&P  500  company  with  an  equity  market  capitalisation  of
approximately US$34 billion.  We have completed real estate acquisitions  with
an aggregate value of US$28 billion.  We are finalising a bridge loan facility
with our  bankers  of  approximately  £3 billion  for  the  purposes  of  this
transaction.  We are confident that,  subject to successful completion of  due
diligence, we  will be  able to  obtain sufficient  resources to  satisfy  our
proposal in full.

Pre-conditions

The announcement of a firm offer under Rule 2.5 of The City Code on  Takeovers
and Mergers (""The City Code"") would be subject to the following pre-conditions
(none of which we will waive):

·    the proposed  acquisition of the  Trafford Centre Group  not having  been
completed;

·    final approval from the board of Simon; and

·    access to satisfactory due diligence.

Any formal offer  would also  be subject to  the normal  terms and  conditions
appropriate to an offer under The City Code.

We reserve the right to announce a firm offer under Rule 2.5 of The City  Code
(i) at less than 425 pence per CSC share (a) if the directors of CSC agree  or
(b) by an amount of up to any  dividend declared, made or paid after the  date
of  this  letter;   and/or  (ii)   including  (an)   alternative  form(s)   of
consideration.

Advisers

We have appointed  Citi, Lazard  and Evercore  as our  financial advisers  and
Freshfields and Wachtell Lipton as our legal advisers.

Status and announcement

This letter, and any  non-contractual obligation arising  from or relating  to
it, is governed by and  construed in accordance with  English law, and is  not
intended to  be  legally  binding  and  shall  not  give  rise  to  any  legal
consequences in any  respect.  We  must emphasise  that this  letter does  not
constitute an offer (or impose  any obligation to make  an offer) nor does  it
evidence a firm intention on our part to  make a formal offer for CSC for  the
purposes of Rule 2.2(a) of The City Code or otherwise and we reserve the right
to terminate our interest in CSC immediately at any stage and without reason.

We shall be publicly announcing the contents of this letter.

Conclusion

We believe that our proposed offer is highly favourable and attractive to  CSC
shareholders.  We are  enthusiastic about  this opportunity  and committed  to
dedicating substantial time and financial resources with a view to  concluding
a transaction as soon as possible.

If you need any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me or
our financial advisers. 

Yours faithfully,

 

 

David Simon
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

Forward looking statements

This  announcement  contains  certain  ""forward  looking  statements"".   These
statements are based on  the current expectations of  the management of  Simon
and are naturally subject  to uncertainty and  changes in circumstances.   The
forward-looking statements contained in  this announcement include  statements
relating to  the expected  effects of  the Acquisition  on CSC,  the  expected
timing  and  scope  of  the  Acquisition,  and  other  statements  other  than
historical facts.

Forward-looking statements include statements typically containing words  such
as ""will"", ""may"",  ""should"", ""believe"",  ""intends"", ""expects"",  ""anticipates"",
""targets"", ""estimates"" and words of  similar import.  Although Simon  believes
that  the  expectations  reflected  in  such  forward-looking  statements  are
reasonable, Simon can give no assurance  that such expectations will prove  to
be correct.   By their  nature, forward-looking  statements involve  risk  and
uncertainty because they  relate to  events and depend  on circumstances  that
will occur in  the future.  There  are a  number of factors  that could  cause
actual results and developments to  differ materially from those expressed  or
implied by such forward looking statements.  These factors include: local  and
global political and  economic conditions;  changes in UK  real estate  market
conditions  and  valuations;  competitors'  actions;  foreign  exchange   rate
fluctuations  and  interest  rate  fluctuations  (including  those  from   any
potential  credit  rating  decline);  legal  or  regulatory  developments  and
changes; the outcome  of any  litigation; the  impact of  any acquisitions  or
similar transactions;  success  of  business and  operating  initiatives;  and
changes in the level  of capital investment.   Other unknown or  unpredictable
factors could cause  actual results  to differ  materially from  those in  the
forward-looking statements.

Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking  statements as  a prediction  of actual  results.   Neither
Simon nor any of its affiliated companies undertakes any obligation to  update
or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new  information,
future events or otherwise, except to the extent legally required. 

Dealing Disclosure Requirements

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the Code, any person  who is interested in 1% or more  of
any class of relevant securities of an offeree company or of any paper offeror
(being any offeror  other than  an offeror  in respect  of which  it has  been
announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must make  an
Opening Position Disclosure  following the  commencement of  the offer  period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any paper offeror is  first
identified. An  Opening  Position  Disclosure  must  contain  details  of  the
person's interests and short  positions in, and rights  to subscribe for,  any
relevant securities of  each of  (i) the offeree  company and  (ii) any  paper
offeror(s). An Opening  Position Disclosure by  a person to  whom Rule  8.3(a)
applies must  be made  by no  later than  3.30 pm  (London time)  on the  10th
business  day  following  the  commencement  of  the  offer  period  and,   if
appropriate, by no later than 3.30 pm  (London time) on the 10th business  day
following the announcement  in which  any paper offeror  is first  identified.
Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or
of a  paper offeror  prior to  the  deadline for  making an  Opening  Position
Disclosure must instead make a Dealing Disclosure.

Under Rule 8.3(b) of the Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in 1%
or more of any class of relevant  securities of the offeree company or of  any
paper offeror  must make  a Dealing  Disclosure  if the  person deals  in  any
relevant securities of the offeree company or of any paper offeror. A  Dealing
Disclosure must contain details of the  dealing concerned and of the  person's
interests and short positions  in, and rights to  subscribe for, any  relevant
securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any paper offeror, save
to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule  8.
A Dealing Disclosure by a person to  whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made  by
no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the business day following the date  of
the relevant dealing.

If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding,
whether formal or  informal, to  acquire or  control an  interest in  relevant
securities of an offeree company or a paper offeror, they will be deemed to be
a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be  made by the offeree company and  by
any offeror and Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree  company,
by any offeror  and by any  persons acting in  concert with any  of them  (see
Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4).

Details of the  offeree and  offeror companies  in respect  of whose  relevant
securities Opening Position Disclosures and  Dealing Disclosures must be  made
can be  found in  the Disclosure  Table  on the  Takeover Panel's  website  at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including  details  of  the  number  of  relevant
securities in issue, when the offer period commenced and when any offeror  was
first identified. If you are  in any doubt as to  whether you are required  to
make an  Opening  Position Disclosure  or  a Dealing  Disclosure,  you  should
contact the Panel' s Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129.

IntercontinentalExchange Proposes To Merge with Chicago Board


of Trade


Compelling Strategic Combination Provides Superior Alternative to Shareholders 
and Derivatives Industry

Strengthens Chicago and U.S. Role in Global Markets by Uniting Historic 
Exchange Leader with Innovative Growth Leader


    ATLANTA, March 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- IntercontinentalExchange, Inc.
(NYSE: ICE) today announced it has made a proposal to the Board of Directors
of CBOT Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BOT) to combine the two companies in a stock-
for-stock transaction that would create the world's most comprehensive
derivatives exchange.

    The combination would result in a premier global futures and over-the-
counter derivatives marketplace headquartered in Chicago. The combined company
would have a leading presence in the major derivatives categories, including
agricultural and energy products, interest rates and metals, and would be
supported by integrated clearing capabilities and state-of-the-art trading
technology. The transaction would promote competition and innovation in the
domestic and global derivatives markets while providing superior opportunities
to leverage the complementary strengths of ICE and CBOT to drive growth,
customer benefits, and shareholder value.


    Terms of the proposed transaction are as follows:
    * ICE would issue 1.42 ICE shares for each CBOT Class A common share,
      valued at $187.34 per CBOT share based on yesterday's closing price of
      ICE shares. This represents a 12.8% premium to CBOT's current share
      price, and a 39.3% premium to its share price on October 16, 2006, the
      day before announcement of its merger agreement with the Chicago
      Mercantile Exchange (NYSE: CME). The $187.34 per share value also
      represents a premium of 10.5% to the current value of the pending
      CME/CBOT transaction to CBOT shareholders.
    * CBOT shareholders would own approximately 51.5% of the combined company
      and, in addition to receiving a premium, would participate in the
      significant strategic and financial benefits of the combination.
    * ICE is committed to preserving the heritage of CBOT, bringing its brand
      and expertise forward on a global scale as the derivatives marketplace
      expands.
    * ICE will commit to the same terms as the CME offer regarding CBOT's open
      auction markets and will protect and grow the CBOT metals complex.
    * ICE proposes to enter into a transaction on terms similar to those in
      the current CBOT merger agreement with CME. Flexibility in the potential
      legal structure of the transaction exists to provide CBOT members who
      hold Chicago Board Options Exchange exercise rights a preferred
      structure to preserve these rights.
    * Unlike a combination of CME and CBOT, ICE believes no significant
      antitrust or other regulatory risks exist in a combination of ICE and
      CBOT and a transaction could be completed quickly, thereby delivering
      both near-term and long-term benefits to all stakeholders of both ICE
      and CBOT.


    Based on publicly available information, ICE estimates transaction
benefits of at least $240 million annually upon the full integration of ICE
and CBOT. In addition to identified expense rationalization and the revenue
growth opportunities available to the combined company, significant clearing
benefits also exist as ICE could provide a fully operational clearing solution
for CBOT's products upon termination of CBOT's existing clearing agreement
with CME in January, 2009. Accordingly, ICE believes the combination would be
accretive to cash earnings per share within 18 months of closing. With access
to CBOT and its management, ICE expects to identify additional opportunities
for the combined company.

    ""This is an extremely compelling combination for Chicago Board of Trade
and IntercontinentalExchange shareholders, trading members, customers,
clearing firms, employees, the derivatives industry and the City of Chicago,""
said Jeffrey C. Sprecher, Chairman and CEO of ICE. ""The CBOT Board of
Directors has the opportunity to achieve a transaction that offers a
considerable premium to the pending CME transaction and, at the same time,
secures the CBOT's position as a leading independent global derivatives
complex based in Chicago. The combined company would be extremely well
positioned in nearly every high-growth derivatives segment, and would have the
platform to capitalize on the many emerging growth opportunities in the
dynamic derivatives landscape on a global scale. The transaction we are
proposing is clearly superior to a combination with the CME for CBOT's
shareholders and other stakeholders.""

    Since January 1, 2006, the value of ICE shares has increased 348% compared
with growth in CBOT shares of 80.5% and in CME shares of 55.5% over the same
period. ICE has successfully completed the acquisitions of International
Petroleum Exchange and the New York Board of Trade, creating substantial value
for the former owners of each organization and delivering exceptional organic
growth through innovation and technology.

    Morgan Stanley is serving as financial advisor to ICE and Sullivan and
Cromwell LLP is serving as legal advisor to ICE.

    March 15, 2007

    CBOT Holdings, Inc.
    141 West Jackson Boulevard
    Chicago, Illinois  60604-2929

    Attention:    Charles P. Carey
                  Chairman of the Board of Directors
                  Jackie Clegg
                  Larry G. Gerdes
                  Special Transaction Committee of the Board of Directors
                  James P. McMillin
                  Non-Exercise Right Members Committee
                  Bernard W. Dan
                  Chief Executive Officer

    Dear Sirs and Madam,


    On behalf of IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. (""ICE"") and its Board of
Directors, I am pleased to submit this proposal to combine ICE with CBOT
Holdings, Inc. (""CBOT Holdings"") in an industry-defining merger. Our proposed
transaction will create the most comprehensive derivatives exchange in the
world, preserve the proud heritage of the Chicago Board of Trade (""CBOT""), and
promote innovation and competition in the domestic and global derivatives
markets. From the perspective of shareholders and CBOT Holdings' trading
community, this combination will generate superior value immediately and in
the longer term.


    Consideration

    We propose a transaction in which each share of CBOT Holdings Class A
common stock will be exchanged for 1.42 shares of ICE Class A common stock.
Based on the closing stock price of ICE as of March 14, 2007, our proposal
represents a price per CBOT Holdings Class A share of $187.34. This price
represents a premium to CBOT Holdings' current price of 12.8%, and a premium
to CBOT Holdings' closing price on October 16, 2006, the day prior to the
public announcement of CBOT Holdings' intended combination with Chicago
Mercantile Exchange Holdings, Inc. (""CME""), of 39.3%.

    In addition to the upfront premium, our proposal allows CBOT Holdings'
shareholders to share in the substantial combination benefits we believe are
available to the combined ICE and CBOT Holdings. The proposed exchange ratio
will result in CBOT Holdings Class A shareholders owning approximately 51.5%
of the combined company. Based upon our review of publicly-available
information on CBOT Holdings, we estimate over $240 million per annum of
combination benefits, on a pre-tax basis, would be realizable through the
combination of our two companies. We are confident we could identify
additional benefits once we have had the opportunity to undertake due
diligence and interact with your management.

    We note that the merger agreement with CME Holdings includes a cash
election of up to $3 billion for CBOT Holdings' shareholders in lieu of
shares. Should you feel that a cash alternative is important to your
shareholders, we would be pleased to explore this option and have access to
significant financing sources should this be required.


    Strategic rationale

    A merger of our two companies is a unique opportunity to create a leading
derivatives trading platform across a broad spectrum of futures and options
products, incorporating our complementary positions in agricultural
commodities and leading capabilities in interest rates, energy, gold and
silver, as well as other financial contracts such as equity indices and
foreign exchange pairs. The combined entity would operate regulated exchanges
in the U.S., Europe, and Asia and also support the global over-the-counter
(OTC) derivatives market.

    Through our recent purchase of the New York Board of Trade (""NYBOT""), ICE
operates a wholly-owned clearinghouse, which will serve as an integrated
platform for the clearing of our combined exchanges' transactions over time.
ICE will also contribute its world-class trading platform. Our technology
provides global accessibility and integrated capabilities for trading futures,
options on futures, and bilateral and cleared OTC markets. We believe that our
market-leading capabilities in supporting OTC trading can be extended to CBOT
Holdings' marketplace. Finally, the combined group will enjoy significant
economies of scale and scope in technology, marketing, and customer
connectivity.


    Chicago Board of Trade's heritage and Chicago home

    We recognize that, for nearly 160 years, the Chicago Board of Trade has
been a major Chicago institution and has anchored the city's position as one
of the world's leading financial centers. CBOT's history of innovation and
growth is unparalleled in the industry. We wish to preserve and enhance this
market position and legacy rather than to subsume it under a larger
organization. Therefore, we propose that the corporate headquarters of the
combined entity will be CBOT's landmark building in Chicago. In addition, we
intend to retain the Chicago Board of Trade name and leverage it to create a
new brand identity for our regulated futures exchanges in New York, London and
Dublin.


    Benefits to CBOT's trading community

    We believe that the creation of a global and integrated agricultural
commodities marketplace, the ability to trade energy side-by-side with a
variety of correlated agricultural products, and the addition of NYBOT's
financial contracts to CBOT's interest rate and equity index products will
promote liquidity and trading opportunities in futures and options products
both on the trading floor and through electronic trading.

    As evidenced by our acquisition of NYBOT, we have made a significant
commitment to our open-auction members and believe that they provide an
important source of liquidity for our markets.  Our proposal contemplates a
substantial commitment to support continued open-auction trading operations in
CBOT's building, as it becomes our global headquarters.


    Governance and management

    We believe the board of directors of the combined company should draw
representatives from current CBOT Holdings directors in addition to continuing
ICE directors, and we look forward to discussing CBOT Holdings board
representation in the new entity with you.

    We envision ongoing and important roles for the key members of current
management of CBOT Holdings, and undertake to form a management group for the
combined company taken from the best elements of each of our teams. I would
retain the role of Chief Executive Officer and look forward to discussing with
the Chief Executive Officer of CBOT Holdings the future roles in the combined
company for him and his management team.


    Combination benefits

    As noted above, we believe that the merger of CBOT Holdings and ICE offers
significant combination benefits. Our wholly-owned clearing platform will
allow us to internalize the clearing services CBOT currently receives from
CME, assuming your clearing agreement with CME is terminated in January, 2009.
By moving current CBOT electronic trading to the ICE platform, we will be able
to decrease technology expense and improve efficiency. We also believe
significant opportunities exist to rationalize redundant general and
administrative expenses when we consolidate operations currently conducted in
Atlanta and New York into the Chicago headquarters of the combined group. We
estimate that these expense and clearing savings would exceed $190 million on
a full run-rate basis by January, 2009.

    We believe that there are also significant opportunities to increase both
the revenues and growth rate of the combined group by providing a single
access point to multiple complementary products. The ability of customers to
cross-margin positions in the combined product suite and in cleared OTC
products will lower friction costs and increase trading activity. Further, we
believe that there are substantial revenue opportunities in supporting the OTC
markets that surround CBOT's existing products. Finally, the financial
opportunity associated with preserving and growing elements of CBOT's
traditional product franchise, such as the precious metals contracts which we
understand may be scheduled for termination, is significant. We estimate that
these additional revenue opportunities would exceed $50 million on a full run-
rate basis within 18 months of closing.

    ICE has the highest rate of growth and highest profit margin of any
company in our industry. This performance has been achieved both organically
and through acquisitions. We have a proven track record in optimizing the
performance of the companies that we have acquired, and have created
significant value for the former owners and other stakeholders of companies
with which we have combined. We are confident that our combined management
team will integrate our two companies in such a way as to maximize the
benefits for all our stakeholders.


    Structure and Merger Agreement

    We have studied the terms of the CME merger agreement and, outside of the
changes necessary to implement the matters outlined in our proposal, we are
prepared to enter into a form of merger agreement with you on similar terms.
However, subject to the implementation of the other terms of our proposal, we
are also amenable to exploring a transaction structure which we believe would
facilitate preservation of your members' CBOE Exercise Rights.


    Conditions, approvals and other matters

    Our board of directors has unanimously approved the submission of this
proposal. Any definitive transaction between us, however, would be subject to
final approvals by our board as well as our shareholders.

    We have based our proposal on publicly-available information, and our
proposal is subject to completion of a confirmatory due diligence review of
CBOT Holdings, which would include discussions with your senior management. We
are available to commence our due diligence review immediately, and we are
confident that, given our knowledge of your business and your cooperation, we
can complete our review and be in a position to execute a definitive
transaction agreement within one week. We are also prepared to give you and
your representatives access to non-public information relating to ICE to
satisfy your due diligence requirements. We are prepared to enter into a
confidentiality agreement with CBOT Holdings that is no less favorable to CBOT
Holdings than the one it entered into with CME.

    Given the complementary nature of the products traded on CBOT, NYBOT and
ICE, we do not anticipate regulatory issues associated with our proposed
merger. In fact, we believe that the futures industry and antitrust regulators
will embrace the creation of a strong derivatives group to protect and enhance
industry competition and innovation. We believe that a merger between CBOT
Holdings and CME Holdings represents a significant concentration of market
power, in particular in such areas as equity index products, interest rate
futures, technology and clearing. The alternative transaction we are proposing
would be strongly pro-competitive and would benefit our mutual customers as
well as our respective shareholders.

    This letter is not intended to create or constitute any legally binding
obligation, liability or commitment by us regarding the proposed transaction,
and, other than any confidentiality agreement we may enter into with you,
there will be no legally binding contract or agreement between us regarding
the proposed transaction unless and until a definitive merger agreement is
executed.  We believe that the proposed transaction could close in the third
quarter of 2007.

    While the CME transaction represents a sale of the company, our proposal
is truly a merger that is intended to preserve the culture and heritage of the
Chicago Board of Trade. We believe our proposal is superior, from both a
financial and strategic perspective, to the CME proposal and is capable of
consummation without material regulatory impediments.

    We and our financial advisors, Morgan Stanley, and our legal advisors,
Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, are prepared to move forward immediately with this
proposal.  We believe that our proposal presents a compelling opportunity for
our companies, our industry, and our customers, and we look forward to your
prompt response.

  Go-Shop Process

Business Wire

ROUND ROCK, Texas -- March 25, 2013

The Special Committee of the Board of Dell Inc. (NASDAQ: DELL) today announced
that the go-shop period provided for in the merger agreement between the
company and entities owned by Michael Dell, Dells Founder, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, and investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake Partners,
has elicited two alternative acquisition proposals. One proposal was submitted
by a group affiliated with a private equity fund managed by Blackstone and the
other by entities affiliated with Carl Icahn. Both proposals are attached.

The Special Committee, consisting of four independent and disinterested
directors, has determined, after consultation with its independent financial
and legal advisors, that both proposals could reasonably be expected to result
in superior proposals, as defined under the terms of the existing merger
agreement. Therefore, each of the Blackstone and Icahn groups is an excluded
party and the Special Committee intends to continue negotiations with both.

The Special Committee also noted that Michael Dell has confirmed to the
Committee his willingness to explore in good faith the possibility of working
with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals.

Alex Mandl, Chairman of the Special Committee, said, We are gratified by the
success of our go-shop process that has yielded two alternative proposals with
the potential to create additional value for Dell shareholders. We intend to
work diligently with all three potential acquirers to ensure the best possible
outcome for Dell shareholders, whichever transaction that may be.

Pursuant to the existing merger agreement, subject to certain requirements,
the Special Committee has the right to terminate the agreement in order to
accept a superior proposal. The Special Committee has not determined that
either the Blackstone proposal or the Icahn proposal in fact constitutes a
superior proposal under the existing merger agreement and neither is at this
stage sufficiently detailed or definitive for such a determination to be
appropriate. There can be no assurance that either proposal will ultimately
lead to a superior proposal. While negotiations continue, the Special
Committee has not changed its recommendation with respect to, and continues to
support, the company's pending sale to entities controlled by Michael Dell and
Silver Lake Partners.

Prior to entering into the existing merger agreement, the Special Committee
undertook a rigorous process, over a period of more than five months, to
evaluate Dells risks, opportunities, and strategic alternatives. These
alternatives included continuing with or modifying the companys existing
business plan, implementing a leveraged recapitalization, changing the
dividend policy, and potentially selling all or parts of the business.

As a result of that process, the Special Committee unanimously determined that
the sale of the company at a premium would be the best alternative for
stockholders, and negotiated aggressively to ensure that stockholders receive
the highest possible value, including securing provisions for a robust
go-shop process. The result was that a number of strategic and financial
parties entered into confidentiality agreements with the company and
Blackstone and Icahn submitted proposals.

The price of $13.65 per share in cash to be paid pursuant to the existing
merger agreement provides value certainty at a 37% premium to the average
price for the 90 days before rumors of the transaction surfaced. The Committee
noted that the Silver Lake Partners raised its bid six times by a total of
approximately $4 billion, or over 20%, during the course of negotiations.

Subject to applicable laws and regulations, the Special Committee undertakes
no obligation, to provide updates or make further statements regarding the
proposals received from Blackstone or Icahn, any revised proposals that may be
received from either of them or the status of discussions with either of them,
unless and until a definitive agreement is reached or such discussions are
terminated.

The alternative acquisition proposals received from Blackstone and Icahn
follow here:

BLACKSTONE PROPOSAL

                          Boulder Acquisition Corp.

                  c/o Blackstone Management Partners L.L.C.

                                                                March 22, 2013

STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Dell Inc.
One Dell Way
Round Rock, Texas 78682
Attention: Alex Mandl, Presiding Director
 
Re: Acquisition Proposal and Request for Designation as Excluded Party
 
 

Dear Mr. Mandl:

On behalf of Boulder Acquisition Corp. (AcquisitionCo), Blackstone
Management Associates VI L.L.C. (in its capacity as general partner of
Blackstone Capital Partners VI L.P.), Francisco Partners III, LP, Insight
Venture Management, LLC and each of their respective affiliates, affiliated
funds and limited partners (all such persons and entities, together with
AcquisitionCo, being collectively referred to herein as the Investor Group),
we hereby submit this Acquisition Proposal and request prompt designation of
the Investor Group as an Excluded Party, as such terms are defined in the
Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Dell Inc., a Delaware corporation
(Dell), and the Parent Parties (as defined therein) dated as of February 5,
2013 (the Merger Agreement).

Thank you for allowing us the access to management and data that we needed to
complete a preliminary review of the Dell business. We believe there is
significant upside in the Dell businesses, we see significant upside in the
value of Dells shares, and our proposed transaction structure (described
below) will deliver significantly greater value to your shareholders than the
value agreed to in the Merger Agreement.

As a result, we would like to proceed in the process to acquire Dell and
hereby submit, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, this
Acquisition Proposal. Subject to confirmatory due diligence and negotiation of
a mutually agreeable merger agreement (which we expect to include
substantially similar terms and conditions as the Merger Agreement, other than
certain changes to mechanical provisions required to implement the structure
of our Acquisition Proposal as described below), we are prepared to enter into
a definitive agreement to acquire Dell in a leveraged recapitalization
transaction where shareholders could choose to receive either all cash or
stock (subject to a cap), in each case valued in excess of $14.25 per share,
representing a Superior Proposal to the $13.65 cash purchase price agreed to
in the Merger Agreement.

We are prepared to invest the time and resources necessary to complete a
transaction along an expedited timeline, and we would contemplate providing
drafts of a definitive transaction agreement (which will include financing
commitment letters), along with our more detailed proposal as soon as possible
following the completion of satisfactory due diligence.

KEY FEATURES OF OUR PROPOSAL

Our Acquisition Proposal contemplates a leveraged recapitalization transaction
with the following features:

  * Shareholders who wish to receive cash will have the opportunity to receive
    greater than $14.25 in cash per share for all of their shares.
  * Shareholders who wish to participate in the ongoing upside of the company
    will have the opportunity to remain as shareholders and receive shares
    (subject to a cap) valued in excess of $14.25, which shares would continue
    to be publicly traded on the Nasdaq.

Our proposed transaction would have several important benefits for Dell
shareholders:

  * Higher price per share for shareholders electing to receive cash
  * Shareholder friendly structure, with the ability to choose cash or stock
  * Leveraged upside for shareholders who elect to remain as shareholders

FINANCING

We intend to fund the transaction using a combination of equity and debt
financing, in addition to Company cash and cash equivalents. We plan to invest
equity amounts in excess of those new equity amounts contemplated by the
Merger Agreement to facilitate the proposed transaction.

Based on discussions with equity co-investors, certain strategic partners, and
debt financing sources, we are highly confident that financing can be
arranged, which will include comparable debt sources and structures as the
existing deal. We are currently working with Morgan Stanley & Co LLC (Morgan
Stanley) as our lead debt financing source to prepare financing, and have had
discussions with other debt financing sources that have indicated a strong
interest to finance our Acquisition Proposal. We have received from Morgan
Stanley a highly confident letter related to our ability to raise the
required debt financing for this transaction. Upon designation of the Investor
Group as an Excluded Party we expect to finalize discussions with other
financing sources on an expedited basis. Additionally, at the time of
execution of definitive agreements with respect to our proposal, we expect to
provide binding financing commitments from debt and equity financing sources
in the form customary for a transaction of this type.

We have held discussions with some of Dells largest shareholders, and we
anticipate inviting them, certain of Dells other shareholders and certain
other strategic and financial partners to participate in the transaction as
part of our group. We would also expect to encourage (but would not require)
the MD Investors (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to participate in our
transaction by rolling over equity held by the MD Investors.

TIMING

We have significant experience structuring and consummating transactions of
this nature, and we believe we can complete our due diligence review and
negotiate the terms and conditions of a Superior Proposal (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) quickly during the next phase of the process. Given our due
diligence to date, we anticipate that the remaining due diligence would focus
on key business, accounting, legal and regulatory matters and could be
completed quickly, assuming full cooperation of Dell and its advisors. As part
of this process, we would expect to have full access to the senior management
team of Dell, certain other key employees, Dells independent accountants and
Dells records, financial and operating data and material agreements
(including the schedules attached to the Merger Agreement).

We are committed to continuing to pursue a transaction on the terms herein,
which we believe will provide a more compelling value proposition to Dell and
its shareholders than currently provided under the Merger Agreement. We
believe that this proposal meets all applicable requirements under the Merger
Agreement to enable the Special Committee to determine that the Investor Group
is an Excluded Party in accordance with the Merger Agreement. Due to the
considerable time commitment and uncertainty of outcome, we will continue our
due diligence and work toward providing a definitive proposal, only upon
receipt of written confirmation from the Special Committee of the Board of
Directors that the Investor Group has been determined to be an Excluded Party
in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

GENERAL

The proposal contained in this letter constitutes an indication of our
interest in pursuing a transaction and does not constitute a binding offer,
agreement or agreement to proceed with the transaction or to otherwise make a
binding offer or agreement at any point in the future.

This indication of interest is submitted by us for review and consideration by
the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Dell on a confidential
basis, and the existence of our discussions and this letter (other than such
disclosure obligations outlined in the Merger Agreement) shall be kept
strictly confidential in accordance with the terms of that certain letter
agreement by and between Blackstone Management Partners L.L.C. and Dell, dated
February 22, 2013.

This letter shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of law principles
thereof.

This proposal will expire at 5:00pm (NY time) on March 28 if you fail to
provide the written confirmation discussed above prior to such time.

Please do not hesitate to contact any of the team members listed below with
any questions.

Sincerely Yours,

BOULDER ACQUISITION CORP.

Re: Acquisition Proposal for Dell Inc. (Dell)

Dear Members of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Dell and
Advisors:

On February 5, 2013, Dell entered into a merger agreement (the February 5
Merger Agreement) with certain entities affiliated with Silver Lake Partners
and Michael S. Dell. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this letter
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the February 5 Merger
Agreement. Section 5.3 of the February 5 Merger Agreement provides, among
other things, that Dell, its Subsidiaries and its Representatives have the
right to initiate, solicit, encourage and receive Acquisition Proposals with
respect to Dell up to the No-Shop Period Start Date. This Acquisition
Proposal, which is detailed below, is being delivered, as contemplated by the
February 5 Merger Agreement, by Icahn Enterprises LP, and Carl C. Icahn, prior
to the No-Shop Period Start Date.

Icahn Enterprises LP

We believe that you will agree that Icahn Enterprises is well able to provide
the $1 billion cash equity capital (in addition to its existing $1 billion
stock position in Dell), and that Mr. Icahn and his affiliates other than
Icahn Enterprises are well able to provide the additional $3 billion cash
equity capital, contemplated in this Acquisition Proposal, which constitutes
an aggregate $5 billion equity commitment. In this regard we invite you to
examine the public filings of Icahn Enterprises and to meet with us regarding
any additional questions you may have. Further, we have excellent relationship
with numerous large banking institutions and we are confident that we would be
able to obtain the debt financing contemplated in our proposal. Although we
are well known for the performance of our investment activities, over time we
have found that our greatest returns have come from the control and ownership
of portfolio companies. For example, in May 2012, Icahn Enterprises purchased
a controlling interest in CVR Energy, Inc. (CVR) for an aggregate purchase
price approximately $2 billion. As of March 11, 2013, based on the closing
sale price of CVR stock and distributions since Icahn Enterprises acquired
control, we had a gain of over $2 billion on our purchase of CVR.

Currently, the portfolio companies owned or controlled by Icahn Enterprises
and Mr. Icahn include among others, the following:

                                                 
                                                   
Name                                 Holdings     Date of Initial Investment
CVR Energy, Inc.                     82%          2011
Tropicana Entertainment Inc.         67%          2008
West Point Home                      100%         2004
Federal Mogul Corporation            78%          2001
Viskase Companies Inc.               70%          2001
XO Holdings                          100%         2001
PSC Metals                           100%         1998
American Railcar Industries Inc.     55%          1994
ACF Industries                       100%         1984
                                                   

The Acquisition Proposal For Dell

As you know, on March 10, 2013 Icahn Enterprises entered into a
confidentiality agreement with Dell and commenced due diligence in support of
an Acquisition Proposal. On March 13, 2013, Jefferies LLC (Jefferies), as a
representative of Icahn Enterprises, entered into a confidentiality agreement
with Dell and commenced due diligence in support of an Acquisition Proposal.
Further, on and after February 8, 2013, Southeastern Asset Management Inc.
(Southeastern) has publicly disclosed its desire to remain a shareholder of
Dell, rather than participate in the merger contemplated by the February 5
Merger Agreement and has suggested that the merger be recast as a transaction
under which Dell shareholders are provided with the opportunity to elect to
continue to hold Dell shares or receive cash, at their option. T. Rowe Price
has similarly opposed the February 5 Merger Agreement. For purposes of this
proposal, Icahn Enterprises assumes that Southeastern and T. Rowe Price and
other larger holders would, if provided the opportunity, support the proposal
set forth below and agree to the matters set forth in the fourth bullet item
of the proposal set forth below.

We hereby propose that we and Dell engage in the following merger transaction
(the Proposed Merger, and the surviving company of the Proposed Merger, the
Surviving Company):

  * Dell will obtain transaction funding composed of the following:

       * $2.0 billion investment ($1 billion by Icahn Enterprises and $1
         billion by Carl C. Icahn and his affiliates other than Icahn
         Enterprises) for the purchase of common shares of the Surviving
         Company (in addition to the shares currently owned by Icahn
         Enterprises and its affiliates) at a price of $15 per share,
         resulting in an additional 133 million shares being issued by the
         Surviving Company. As contemplated in the fifth bullet item below,
         Mr. Icahn and his affiliates other than Icahn Enterprises, are
         willing to commit an additional $2 billion of cash equity financing,
         for an aggregate $5 billion total equity commitment to this
         Acquisition Proposal.
       * $7.4 billion of cash currently available at Dell.
       * $1.712 billion in new factoring receivable facility (total factoring
         receivable facility of $3.0 billion).
       * $5.218 billion in new debt.
       * We understand that this Proposed Merger contemplates less total
         leverage on the Surviving Company than under the February 5 Merger
         Agreement.

  * In connection with the Proposed Merger, Dell shareholders will be entitled
    to elect to receive either: (x) shares of the Surviving Company on a
    one-to-one basis with their current holdings; or (y) an aggregate of up to
    $15.65 billion in cash (the Payment Funding) payable at a rate of $15
    per share. If the Payment Funding is fully utilized this would result in
    1.043 billion shares (58.1% of the current outstanding) being subject to
    the Proposed Merger. If shareholders electing to receive cash exceed the
    maximum number of shares that may be acquired with the Payment Funding,
    then such elections will be accepted on a pro rated basis. If electing
    shareholders are insufficient to utilize all of the Payment Funding, then
    the balance will be distributed to all of the remaining shareholders of
    the Surviving Company as a special dividend (the Special Dividend).
  * In addition to the Payment Funding, Icahn Enterprises anticipates that
    Dell would be required to pay the breakup fee under the February 5 Merger
    Agreement of $180 million, and that Dell would incur other deal fees and
    expenses in the Proposed Merger of approximately $500 million, for a
    maximum aggregate use of funds of approximately $16.33 billion.
  * Neither Icahn Enterprises (which together with its affiliates, currently
    owns approximately 80 million shares of Dell), Southeastern (which
    publicly reports ownership of approximately 146.5 million shares of Dell),
    T. Rowe Price (which publicly reports ownership of approximately 82
    million shares of Dell), nor other large holders that so agree
    (collectively with Icahn Enterprise, Southeastern, and T. Rowe Price, the
    Rollover Holders), would be eligible to elect to receive cash or shares
    in the Proposed Merger, but rather their existing common stock position in
    Dell would rollover into the Surviving Company. Rollover Holders would
    receive the Special Dividend, if any.
  * Pursuant to the Proposed Merger, if all eligible existing Dell
    shareholders elect to receive cash, then approximately 58.1% of the
    currently outstanding Dell shares would be subject to the Proposed Merger
    and following the completion of the Proposed Merger, Icahn Enterprises and
    its affiliates would own 24.1% of the outstanding shares of the Surviving
    Company; Southeastern and its affiliates would own 16.6% of the
    outstanding shares of the Surviving Company; T. Rowe Price and its
    affiliates would own 9.3% of the Surviving Company and the remaining
    public shareholders would own 50% of the shares of the Surviving Company.
    The opportunity exists to increase the number of shares cashed out by
    non-Rollover Holders in the Proposed Merger, if the large holders agree
    with Icahn Enterprises to become Rollover Holders. Further, Mr. Icahn and
    his affiliates other than Icahn Enterprises would be willing to commit (in
    addition to the equity investment provided for in the first bullet item
    above) an additional $2 billion of equity capital in cash, in the event
    that Southeastern, T. Rowe Price or other existing large Dell shareholders
    do not agree to become Rollover Holders.
  * Closing is anticipated to occur in July 2013.

This proposal contemplates the negotiation, execution and delivery of a
definitive agreement (the Definitive Agreement) containing the terms and
conditions set forth herein, together with covenants, representations,
warranties and indemnification provisions which are satisfactory to both
parties (including, if so requested, limits on the election of merger
consideration) and which are typical and standard in a transaction of this
nature.

This letter is a non-binding proposal. Neither Icahn Enterprises, Mr. Icahn,
their respective affiliates, officers or directors or representatives, have,
nor will this proposal letter or any discussions or communications among the
parties, create or constitute, any offer, obligation, contract, commitment or
duty of any kind or character, to engage in, negotiate or enter into or
complete a transaction. Only a Definitive Agreement executed and delivered by
the parties thereto, shall be binding upon the parties.

We look forward to proceeding with negotiations as promptly as possible and
are prepared, together with Jefferies, to commit the resources to develop a
Definitive Agreement with you. In addition, we look forward to receiving your
confirmation that the Special Committee has concluded that our proposal is or
could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal.

Very truly yours,

/S/

US Airways Proposes to Merge With Delta



Transaction Valued at Approximately $8.0 Billion in Cash and Stock

Provides 25 Percent Premium to Current Trading Price of Delta's Prepetition 
Unsecured Claims

Merger Expected to Generate $1.65 Billion in Annual Synergies

Consumers Will Have the Advantages of a Larger, Full-Service Provider With the 
Cost Structure of a Low-Fare Carrier


    TEMPE, Ariz., Nov. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- US Airways Group, Inc.
(NYSE: LCC) announced today that it has made a merger proposal to Delta Air
Lines, Inc. (OTC: DALRQ) under which both companies would combine upon Delta's
emergence from bankruptcy.  The proposal would provide approximately
$8.0 billion of value in cash and stock to Delta's unsecured creditors.  Delta
creditors would receive $4.0 billion in cash and 78.5 million shares of US
Airways stock with an aggregate value of approximately $4.0 billion based on
the closing price of US Airways' stock as of Nov. 14, 2006.

    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20050223/LAW097LOGO )

    The combination of US Airways and Delta would create one of the world's
largest airlines and would operate under the Delta name.  Customers would
benefit from expanded choice as well as the reach and services of a
large-scale provider within the cost structure of a low-fare carrier.  As a
combined company, the ""New"" Delta would be the number one airline across the
Atlantic and the second largest airline to the Caribbean.  The New Delta would
reach more than 350 destinations across five continents, including North and
South America, Europe, Asia and Africa.  In the U.S., the combination would
create a leading competitor in the Eastern U.S. and an enhanced position in
the Western U.S.  The combined company would be the number one airline at
155 airports.  The New Delta would also be uniquely positioned to compete with
low cost and legacy carriers.

    US Airways' proposal represents a 25 percent premium over the current
trading price of Delta's prepetition unsecured claims as of Nov. 14, 2006
(40 cents/dollar), assuming that there will ultimately be $16.0 billion of
unsecured claims.  The proposal also represents a 40 percent premium over the
average trading price for Delta unsecured claims over the last thirty days.

    US Airways believes that the combination will generate at least
$1.65 billion in annual synergies, including $935 million in network
synergies, predominantly from optimization of the airlines' complementary
networks, including rationalization of network overlap, which will result in a
10 percent reduction of the combined airlines' capacity, reducing unprofitable
flying and improving the mix of traffic.  In addition, $710 million in net
cost synergies will be achieved by combining facilities in overlap airports
and eliminating redundant systems and overhead.  Significantly, the
opportunity to generate more than half of these synergies could be lost if a
merger is delayed until after Delta emerges from bankruptcy.  The merger is
expected to be accretive to US Airways' earnings in the first full year after
completion of the merger.

    US Airways Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker stated, ""We
believe that the combination of US Airways and Delta, like the US Airways /
America West merger we completed in September 2005, is extremely compelling
and will create significant value for each of our stakeholders.  The combined
company will be a more effective and profitable competitor in the current
fragmented marketplace, with the ability to better meet the continuing
evolution of the airline industry.  We will be flying under the Delta brand
name, which is recognized around the world.

    ""Delta creditors will receive significantly greater value under this
proposal than they would under any standalone plan for Delta.  US Airways
shareholders and Delta creditors will benefit from the significant upside
potential of the combined company through their respective ownership stakes.

    ""Even with a 10 percent reduction in capacity, all existing U.S.
destinations served today by US Airways and Delta will remain part of the new,
improved network.  Consumers will have the advantages of a larger,
full-service airline with the cost structure of a low-fare carrier, and the
communities we serve, as well as those Delta serves, will have access to a
wider range of network options.  More than ever, the New Delta will be able to
connect our customers to the people and places they want to visit.

    ""All of the employees of the New Delta will benefit from working for a
larger and more competitive airline.  As we demonstrated during our
US Airways / America West merger, long-term job security for employees in our
industry results from sound economics and a healthy business able to compete
in our changing marketplace,"" Parker concluded.

    The New Delta will create a more comprehensive global route network that
will provide more choice for travelers and attract new customers to key
markets.  In addition, many travelers have already benefited from the US
Airways / America West merger.  Since the merger, US Airways has lowered
leisure fares in nearly 350 markets with discounts ranging from 10 percent to
75 percent (an average reduction of 24 percent within those markets).  US
Airways has also lowered business fares in nearly 400 markets during the same
period with reductions ranging from 10 percent to 83 percent (an average
reduction of 37 percent within those markets).

    Paul Reeder, President of PAR Capital Management, US Airways' largest
shareholder, said, ""We enthusiastically support this transaction, which we
believe offers the opportunity to build upon US Airways' current competitive
position.  We have confidence in the US Airways management team, the
$1.65 billion in identified synergies, and the potential upside for US Airways
shareholders.""

    Below is the text of the letter that US Airways sent to Gerald Grinstein,
Delta's Chief Executive Officer.



                                             November 15, 2006
    VIA FACSIMILE
    Mr. Gerald Grinstein
    Chief Executive Officer
    Delta Air Lines, Inc.
    Atlanta, GA 30320-6001

    Dear Jerry:
        Last Spring we had a conversation about a potential merger of US
    Airways and Delta.  As you know, following that conversation, I sent you
    a letter on September 29, 2006, outlining our thoughts about a
    transaction, describing the significant benefits that could be achieved
    for both of our respective stakeholder groups from this type of
    transaction, and proposing to meet with you and your team to work together
    to further consider and develop our proposal.  I was disappointed that you
    declined to meet or even enter into discussions in your letter of
    October 17, 2006.  Because the benefits of a merger of US Airways and
    Delta are so compelling to both of our companies' stakeholders, we believe
    it is important to inform them about our proposal.  Therefore, we are
    simultaneously releasing this letter to the public.
        The Board of Directors and management team of US Airways believe that
    a combination of Delta and US Airways presents a significantly greater
    value for Delta's creditors, customers, employees and partners than a plan
    to emerge from bankruptcy on a standalone basis.  We also believe that,
    unless we act quickly to pursue a combination through the actions that can
    be taken during Delta's bankruptcy process, our respective stakeholders
    will not be able to realize what we believe are substantial economic
    benefits from such a combination.

        Merger Proposal.  We propose a merger of Delta and US Airways in a
    transaction in which Delta prepetition unsecured creditors would receive
    $4.0 billion in cash plus 78.5 million shares of US Airways' common stock.
    Based upon the closing price of US Airways' common stock of $50.93 on
    November 14, 2006, the equity component represents a value of
    approximately $4.0 billion.  As a result of this transaction, immediately
    following the merger, Delta unsecured creditors would own approximately
    45 percent of the combined company.
        This proposal represents an aggregate of approximately $8.0 billion in
    value to Delta's prepetition unsecured creditors, before taking into
    account realization of any of the significant additional value from the
    synergies we believe are achievable.  Even prior to the realization of any
    synergy value, this proposal represents a 25 percent premium over the
    current trading price of Delta's prepetition unsecured claims as of
    November 14, 2006 (40 cents/dollar), assuming that there will ultimately
    be $16.0 billion of unsecured claims.  The proposal also represents a
    40 percent premium over the average trading price for Delta unsecured
    claims over the last thirty days.  We believe that this proposal, which is
    based on publicly available information, fully values Delta.

        Synergy Value.  What makes this proposal most compelling for both
    Delta creditors and US Airways shareholders are the significant synergies
    that we believe can be readily achieved in this proposed transaction.  We
    have preliminarily identified annual network and cost synergies in excess
    of $1.65 billion, which at a median industry EBITDAR multiple of
    5.0x translates into approximately $8.3 billion of additional value
    creation.  This is value that neither of our teams, no matter how well
    managed, could create independently.  Under the combination, these
    synergies would be shared by Delta creditors and US Airways shareholders
    in proportion to their initial ownership in the combined company.
        The synergies would be generated only through an appropriately timed
    transaction, and under our current analysis we believe would be as
    follows:

    *  Approximately $710 million would be realized through expense
       reductions.  The largest savings would be in consolidation of
       information systems, reduction of overhead and consolidation of
       facilities.  Additional savings are expected through lower distribution
       costs and renegotiation of our collective contracts with vendors.
       Based upon our experience and synergies achieved with the merger of
       US Airways and America West, we believe this estimate is conservative.

    *  Another $935 million would be realized through network rationalization
       synergies.  Network rationalization savings would be generated by
       managing the combined networks to ensure that the combined fleet size
       is better matched to passenger demand.  Network synergies would also
       arise from better serving our current customers, and by increasing our
       competitive presence, attracting new customers and corporate accounts
       in markets where neither carrier today is a significant competitor.

        In our US Airways/America West merger, we preliminarily identified
    approximately $250 million in potential annual cost synergies that we
    believed could be realized in that transaction.  After having successfully
    completed that transaction over a year ago, we have now identified over
    $300 million in cost synergies, outperforming our expectations.
    Year-to-date, US Airways' RASM is up 17.1 percent versus the industry
    being up 9.1 percent, which translates into $425 million in network
    synergies already this year.  Accordingly, we have a high level of
    confidence that we can achieve at a minimum the synergies that we have
    identified in a potential Delta / US Airways merger.
        Our analysis presumes that a merger would proceed in the same fashion
    as the US Airways / America West transaction, with the closing in
    conjunction with Delta's emergence from bankruptcy.  As I have previously
    indicated to you, if we model a merger of our companies after Delta
    emerges from bankruptcy standalone, our synergy estimates are cut in half.
    We do not believe that simply allowing that potential value to evaporate
    is in the best interests of any constituency.

        Financing and Structure.  We have obtained a financing commitment from
    Citigroup to provide $7.2 billion in new financing for this transaction.
    This funding would be utilized to refinance Delta's debtor-in-possession
    credit facility, refinance US Airways' existing senior secured facility
    with GE Capital, and provide the funding for the $4.0 billion cash portion
    of our offer.  All other allowed secured debt and administrative claims
    would be assumed or paid in full.
        Preliminarily, we would intend to follow the model used successfully
    in the US Airways/America West merger for this transaction.  We would, of
    course, seek to structure the transaction in a tax efficient manner for
    our respective stakeholders, maximizing Delta's net operating loss
    carryforwards.

        Integration.  Our proposal contemplates the creation of the leading
    global airline operating under the ""Delta"" name and brand.  To streamline
    our operations and capitalize on potential synergies, we would expect to
    develop together an integration plan, and identify areas in which
    efficiencies can be maximized, including appropriate rationalization of
    operational centers.

        Regulatory Matters.  We have worked with antitrust counsel to analyze
    this transaction and believe that any antitrust issues can be resolved.

        Labor Matters.  We believe that this transaction is in the best
    interests of the employees of US Airways and Delta because of the strength
    and stability of the company that the transaction will produce.  Also, we
    expect that we would move to the highest of the existing labor costs in
    every group.  Because the wage rates for Delta and US Airways employees
    are not markedly different, we do not anticipate that this action will
    have a material negative impact, and that fact has been included in our
    analysis.  Similar to the US Airways / America West merger in which there
    were no furloughs of mainline operating group employees, our current model
    does not assume furloughs of employees in the mainline operating groups.

        Conditions.  Our proposal is conditioned on satisfactory completion of
    a due diligence investigation, which we believe can be completed
    expeditiously.  In addition, the proposed transaction would be conditioned
    on the bankruptcy court's approval of a mutually agreeable plan of
    reorganization that would be predicated upon the merger, regulatory
    approvals and approval of the shareholders of US Airways.  Given our
    analysis to date, we are confident that our joint efforts would result in
    satisfaction of these conditions and a successful combination of our
    companies in a timely manner.

        This proposal presents an opportunity for Delta creditors to receive
    significantly higher recoveries than they can receive under any standalone
    plan for Delta.  It is also an opportunity for US Airways shareholders to
    benefit from the significant upside potential of the combination.
    Consumers will benefit from expanded choice as well as the reach and
    services of a large-scale provider within the cost structure of a low-fare
    carrier.  Our employees will benefit from a more competitive employer and
    our willingness to adopt highest common denominator employee costs.
        As I expressed to you previously, I understand that you and your team
    have worked extremely hard on your own restructuring, and greatly respect
    all that you have accomplished to make Delta a healthy, viable airline.
    We simply believe that a combination with US Airways will produce even
    more value for your creditors and our shareholders, and that this is a
    unique opportunity to create an airline that is even better positioned to
    thrive long into the future, whatever that future might bring to the
    industry, greatly benefiting our employees and customers.
        We and our advisors, Citigroup Corporate and Investment Banking and
    Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, are ready to commence due
    diligence and to negotiate definitive documentation immediately, and
    request that you agree to work with us so that this alternative to your
    standalone plan can be quickly and fully developed.  We are prepared to
    meet with you, Delta's Board, Delta's Official Committee of Unsecured
    Creditors, and any major Delta creditor or other stakeholder, to achieve
    this outcome.  I believe we owe it to our respective stakeholders to
    pursue this opportunity vigorously.

        I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        Respectfully,

        /s/ Doug Parker



    US Airways has committed financing from Citigroup for the proposed
transaction for $7.2 billion, representing $4.0 billion to fund the cash
portion of the offer and $3.2 billion in refinancing at both companies.

Fitch Affirms MidAmerican Holdings on Constellation Merger;

Outlook Stable




CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 18, 2008
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of MidAmerican Energy
Holdings Corp. (MEHC) following today's announcement that the company
has reached a tentative agreement to purchase the equity of
Constellation Energy Group (CEG) for approximately $4.7 billion in an
all-cash transaction at $26.50 per share. The ratings of MEHC are
currently as follows:

   -- Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+';

   -- Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB+';

   -- Trust preferred stock at 'BBB';

   -- Short-term IDR/commercial paper at 'F2'.

   Upon signing a definitive merger agreement, which is expected to
occur tomorrow, MEHC will purchase $1 billion of CEG preferred stock
with an 8% coupon. Fitch does not expect MEHC's current capital
structure to be materially impacted by closing of the merger
transaction because MEHC's $4.7 billion investment will be funded by
common and trust preferred equity from its parent, Berkshire Hathaway
(BRK, IDR rated 'AAA', Stable Outlook by Fitch). The company's
debt-to-total capitalization was 66.2%, and the ratio of
debt-to-EBITDA was 5.1 times (x) for the 12 month period ended June
30, 2008.

   Fitch notes that MEHC's acquisition of CEG is consistent with the
company's strategy to acquire domestic power and gas operations. Over
time, Fitch would expect CEG to reduce commodity trading activities
under MEHC ownership. Furthermore, MEHC continues to benefit from
predictable cash flow and solid stand-alone credit profiles of its six
existing regulated subsidiaries: including PacifiCorp (IDR rated 'BBB'
by Fitch), MidAmerican Energy Co. (IDR rated 'A-' by Fitch), two
domestic natural gas interstate pipelines (Northern Natural Gas and
Kern River, both rated 'A-' senior unsecured debt, Outlook Stable) and
two electric distribution companies in the UK. MEHC's regulated
operations provide the parent company with a diverse geographic and
operational stream of cash flows.

   Fitch will meet with management of both CEG and MEHC to discuss
other provisions of the merger agreement, business plans over the near
term, and longer term strategic plans for the integration and
operation of CEG's businesses. The acquisition is subject to a number
of federal and state regulatory approvals. Fitch expects to comment
more fully on the acquisition following meetings with management of
MEHC and CEG and receipt of detailed information as to the acquisition
financing, financial management policies, and longer term strategic
plans.

   MEHC, a majority-owned subsidiary of BRK, provides electric and
gas service to approximately 6.9 million customers worldwide through
its retail subsidiaries. MEHC also has a 50% interest in CE Generation
LLC, a power project holding company with US geothermal and gas-fired
power projects.

   For further information on MEHC, please refer to Fitch's credit
update on the company dated Sept. 2, 2008.

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.
Published ratings, criteria and methodologies are available from this
site, at all times. Fitch's code of conduct, confidentiality,

Cleveland-Cliffs and Alpha Natural Resources to Merge, Creating

Cliffs Natural Resources, a Leading Diversified Mining and Natural Resources 
Company



   --  Dramatically Increased Size and Scale

   --  Equity Purchase Price of Approximately $10 Billion or $128
        Per Alpha Share

   --  Pro Forma Enterprise Value of Over $22 Billion


CLEVELAND & ABINGDON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 16, 2008
Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF) and Alpha Natural Resources, Inc.
(NYSE: ANR) today announced that each company's Board of Directors has
approved a definitive merger agreement under which Cleveland-Cliffs
will acquire all outstanding shares of Alpha in a cash and stock
transaction valued at approximately $10 billion.

   Under the terms of the agreement, for each share of Alpha common
stock, Alpha stockholders would receive 0.95 Cleveland-Cliffs common
shares and $22.23 in cash. Based on Cleveland-Cliffs' closing stock
price on July 15, 2008, Alpha stockholders would receive $128.12 per
share, which represents a premium of 35% to Alpha's closing stock
price on July 15, 2008.

   The combined company, which will be renamed Cliffs Natural
Resources, will become one of the largest U.S. mining companies and be
positioned as a leading diversified mining and natural resources
company. Cliffs Natural Resources' mine portfolio will include nine
iron ore facilities and more than 60 coal mines located across North
America, South America and Australia. The company's significant
position in both iron ore and metallurgical coal will make it a major
supplier to the global steel industry, as well as provide a platform
for further diversification both geographically and in terms of the
mineral and resource products it sells.

   Upon the transaction's close, Cliffs Natural Resources would have
estimated combined pro forma 2008 revenue of nearly $6.5 billion and
EBITDA of $1.9 billion. The company's estimated 2009 revenue would
reach $10 billion with estimated EBITDA of $4.7 billion.

   Joseph A. Carrabba, Cleveland-Cliffs' chairman, president and
chief executive officer, said, ""Today's announcement represents a
significant strategic milestone for both companies. Cliffs Natural
Resources will be positioned as a diversified natural resources
company with significant holdings in a variety of important minerals.
By combining our companies' complementary operations and management
capabilities, we will be well positioned to meet the world's
increasing demand for raw materials. Since its inception in 2002,
Alpha has been highly respected for its industry leading expertise
around both the operation and acquisition/integration of coal
properties, and we are confident our two management teams and more
than 8,900 employees will achieve great things together.""

   Michael J. Quillen, Alpha's chairman and chief executive officer,
said, ""Together, Alpha and Cleveland-Cliffs will have the size, the
management depth and the mining expertise to compete on the global
stage as demand for raw materials continues to increase around the
world. This transaction is financially compelling for Alpha's
stockholders, who will benefit from enhanced value today alongside
growth opportunities in the future. We look forward to working
together with Joe Carrabba and the Cleveland-Cliffs management team to
realize the substantial opportunities that this combination presents.""

   STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS OF THE COMBINATION

   --  Enhanced size and scale. The combined company's enhanced size
        and scale will enable it to efficiently offer a broad
        portfolio of various iron ore and metallurgical coal types to
        meet the growing needs of world steel producers. Cliffs
        Natural Resources will have a reserve base of approximately
        one billion tons of iron ore and approximately one billion
        tons of metallurgical and thermal coal. The company
        anticipates having an annual sales volume in excess of 30
        million tons of iron ore and nearly 18 million tons of
        metallurgical coal, making it one of the largest suppliers to
        the world's steel industry.

   --  Robust platform for growth and diverse business mix. The
        combined company will have a more diverse revenue stream and
        will be well-positioned to continue its aggressive growth. In
        addition to leading positions in iron ore and metallurgical
        coal, the company will also ship approximately 17 million tons
        of thermal coal, which is used primarily for electricity
        generation by utility companies.

   --  Shared cultural commitment to integrity, safety and the
        environment. Both Cleveland-Cliffs and Alpha share the same
        core values of protecting the occupational health and welfare
        of every employee by designing and implementing best-in-class
        safety standards and practices in the workplace. Equally
        importantly, both companies recognize that the processing of
        the earth's mineral resources must be accomplished in a
        socially responsible manner.

   --  Strong financial position. The combined company is expected to
        have a strong credit profile. Year-end 2008 pro forma leverage
        is expected to be 1.2x EBITDA. The company expects to generate
        substantial free cash flow, enabling significant debt
        reduction and supporting future growth. In 2009, the
        transaction is expected to be accretive to current analyst
        expectations for Cleveland-Cliffs.

   --  Operating synergies. Cliffs Natural Resources expects to
        realize annual synergies of at least $200 million beginning in
        2010, with the majority being achieved through enhanced coal
        processing and blending efficiencies along with elimination of
        duplicative administrative expenses associated with two public
        companies.

   TRANSACTION TERMS

   Under the terms of the transaction, Cleveland-Cliffs will acquire
all of the outstanding common shares of Alpha Natural Resources for
aggregate consideration of approximately $10 billion. For each share
of Alpha common stock, Alpha stockholders would receive 0.95
Cleveland-Cliffs common shares and $22.23 in cash.

   The aggregate consideration comprises $1.7 billion in cash and
approximately 71 million new shares of Cleveland-Cliffs common stock.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is providing an underwriting commitment for
up to $1.9 billion which will be used to finance the transaction. The
combined company expects to generate strong operating cash flow which
it will use to pay down debt. Upon completion of the transaction,
Alpha stockholders would own approximately 40% of the combined company
and Cleveland-Cliffs shareholders would own approximately 60%.

   BOARD, MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

   Following the close of the transaction, Cleveland-Cliffs' Board of
Directors will be expanded by two seats to be filled by two current
Alpha Natural Resources directors, Michael Quillen and Glenn
Eisenberg. Joseph Carrabba will serve as Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of the combined company, and Michael Quillen will serve as
non-executive Vice Chairman.

   Cliffs Natural Resources will have two operating divisions--Iron
Ore and Coal. Kevin Crutchfield, currently president of Alpha Natural
Resources, will become president of the combined company's coal
businesses. Donald Gallagher, currently Cleveland-Cliffs' president,
North American Business Unit, will become president of the combined
company's iron ore businesses. Cleveland-Cliffs' executive vice
president and chief financial officer, Laurie Brlas, will remain chief
financial officer of the combined company.

   Cliffs Natural Resources' world headquarters will be located in
Cleveland. The iron ore business will operate from Cleveland and the
coal business from Abingdon, Va.

   APPROVALS AND TIMING

   The transaction is subject to approval by Cleveland-Cliffs and
Alpha shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of customary closing
conditions and regulatory approvals, including expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The transaction
is expected to close by the end of 2008.

Penn National Gaming Agrees to Be Acquired by Certain Funds

Managed by Affiliates of Fortress Investment Group LLC And Centerbridge Partners LP For $67.00 Per Share in Cash 
Transaction Valued at Approximately $8.9 Billion




WYOMISSING, Penn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 15, 2007
Penn National Gaming, Inc. (Nasdaq: PENN) today announced it has
entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by certain funds
managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group LLC (NYSE: FIG) and
Centerbridge Partners LP in an all-cash transaction valued at
approximately $8.9 billion, including the planned repayment of
approximately $2.8 billion of Penn National's outstanding debt.

   Under the terms of the agreement, Penn National shareholders will
receive $67.00 in cash for each outstanding Penn National share. The
purchase consideration represents a premium of approximately 31% over
Penn National's closing share price on June 14, 2007. Penn National
Gaming has approximately 85.5 million shares outstanding.

   The Board of Directors of Penn National Gaming has determined that
the merger is fair to and in the best interests of Penn National and
its shareholders, and recommends that Penn National Gaming
shareholders adopt and approve the merger agreement.

   Peter M. Carlino, Chief Executive Officer of Penn National
commented, ""Since the Company's 1994 initial public offering, Penn
National Gaming has transformed itself from the owner of a single
racetrack into one of the premier gaming companies in America.
Throughout our rapid rise as a publicly traded company, we focused on
achieving growth through disciplined financial and risk management.
Our Board of Directors' action approving this transaction underscores
our thirteen year commitment to consistently generate value for our
shareholders. Fortress and Centerbridge are both leading private
equity firms with proven track records and strong reputations. This
is a very attractive valuation for our shareholders, at a time when
the financial markets are recognizing the strong investment rationale
for gaming companies.

   ""This transaction will bring Penn National Gaming new owners who
share our vision and support our long-term strategy of growth through
continued capital investments in our existing properties through a
de-centralized local management structure, employee training and
advancement, internally initiated expansion and development
opportunities and acquisitions. I know the Penn National Gaming
corporate and regional management teams and our 15,000 talented
employees are looking forward to working with Fortress and
Centerbridge to ensure the ongoing competitiveness of our facilities
and the substantial growth opportunities made possible by our business
model and strategy.""

M. Carlino; Sr. Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, William J.
Clifford; and, Executive Vice President, Operations, Leonard M.
DeAngelo; as well as other members of its corporate management team,
its property level management and personnel are expected to remain
with the company.

   The merger agreement permits Penn National Gaming, with the
assistance of its advisors, to solicit superior proposals from other
parties for the 45 day period following the date the merger agreement
was executed. There can be no assurances that the solicitation of
proposals will result in an alternative transaction.

   The transaction is expected to be completed in approximately
twelve to sixteen months, and is subject to shareholder approval, FTC
approval and approvals from state gaming and racing authorities, as
well as satisfaction of certain customary conditions.

   The merger agreement does not contain a financing condition. In
addition, if the merger is not consummated by June 15, 2008, the per
share purchase price will be increased by $0.0149 per day.

Qantas Accepts $8.64B Takeover Offer


By MERAIAH FOLEY
     Sydney, Australia (AP) -- Qantas Airways said Thursday it
had accepted an $8.64 billion (11.1 billion Australian dollar)
takeover offer from a private equity consortium including
Australia's Macquarie Bank and the Texas Pacific Group -- one
of the biggest corporate buyouts in Australian history.
     Qantas Chairman Margaret Jackson said the board had
unanimously agreed to recommend to shareholders that they
accept the offer of 5.60 Australian dollars ($4.40) a share
from the consortium, removing the national carrier from the
stock market 11 years after it was sold by the Australian
government.
     The announcement follows Qantas' rejection on Wednesday of
the group's offer of 5.50 Australian dollars a share.
     ""It is a very momentous and exciting day for Qantas,""
Jackson told a media briefing after securing the improved deal
from the consortium, which includes Australia's largest
investment bank, Macquarie, and buyout giant Texas Pacific
Group, a long-term investor in the U.S. aviation sector.
     In addition to the better price, Jackson said the new offer
included fewer conditions and the removal of a break fee
payable to the consortium if shareholders or government
regulators fail to approve the deal.
     ""We ended the day with a price that was compelling, no
break fee and conditions that we can live with,"" she said.
     Jackson said the consortium's bid reflected the airline's
true value, and was 33 percent higher than Qantas shares were
trading at before takeover speculation began in early November.
     ""The directors believe this offer allows Qantas
shareholders to realize significant value for their shares that
has not been fully recognized in the public market,"" Jackson
said.
     After a brief trading halt Thursday, the airline's stock
finished 3.7 percent higher at 5.28 Australian dollars. If
shareholders approve the deal, the shares will stop trading and
be removed from the market.
     The 86-year-old airline has remained one of the few
profitable global carriers in recent years, amid soaring oil
prices and concerns about terrorism in the wake of the Sept.
11, 2001, attacks and health fears spurred by outbreaks of SARS
and bird flu.
     The board's recommendation must now be approved by
Australia's corporate regulators, Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission and the Foreign Investment Review Board, as
well as 90 percent of Qantas shareholders.
     If approved, the deal will represent one of Australia's
largest corporate takeovers, after the 2001 purchase by
Singapore Telecommunications, or SingTel, of telecommunications
company Optus for about 14 billion.
     Jackson Australian dollars said the deal would leave the
iconic airline, easily identified by its red and white kangaroo
logo, in Australian hands -- a move likely to improve its
chances of winning government approval.
     Australian law limits foreign-ownership of Qantas at 49
percent, with each overseas individual allowed to hold a
maximum 25 percent of shares.
     The consortium, called Airline Partners Australia, said it
plans to stay within those restrictions. Australian finance
company Allco is the biggest player in the group through Allco
Equity Partners, which has 35 percent of voting rights, and
Allco Finance Group, with 11 percent. Macquarie has around 15
percent.
     Total foreign investors would hold less than 40 percent,
including Fort Worth-based Texas Pacific Group with less than
15 percent, Canada's Onex Corp. with 9 percent and unnamed
other foreign investment funds each holding less than 15
percent.
     Prime Minister John Howard said his government will keep an
eye on the takeover to ensure it meets the foreign-ownership
caps, set as part of the 1995 privatization of the Sydney-based
airline.
     ""We are going to watch it, but we are not going to take
sides,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. ""It is
a matter for the shareholders, but the laws will need to be
complied with to the full.""
     He said Australian laws would not be changed to accommodate
the takeover, which he hoped was in the airline's best
interest.
     ""I hope the Qantas we know is the Qantas we keep,"" he said.
""People like Qantas, it's an icon.""
     Bob Mansfield, the director Airline Partners Australia,
said the consortium supported Qantas' existing management and
its plans for large capital expenditure, including plans to
invest more than 10 billion Australian dollars ($7.87 billion)
over the next five years and buy more than 70 new aircraft.
     ""Qantas would retain the current Australian management and
their growth strategy, a strategy that does not involve a break
up of the airline, cuts to regional services or the movement of
maintenance operations offshore,"" Mansfield said.
     The fact that Qantas will remain majority-Australian owned
diminishes Treasurer Peter Costello's ability to use his
""national interest"" powers to block the sale, as he did with
Royal Dutch Shell's $10 billion Australian dollars bid for
Australian energy giant Woodside Petroleum Ltd. in 2001.
     ""The government is likely to be a bit nervous, but they
will be reluctant to stop it given the message that sends to
offshore investors,"" said Jason Bloom, an analyst at Deutsche
Bank. ""With the federal election coming up, there will be some
pretty strong comments coming out of union groups, from
consumer groups, so I am sure they will take it pretty
seriously.""
     The Australian Council of Trade Unions has already warned
that the consortium may slash jobs and reduce wages if it wins
control of Qantas, one of Australia's biggest employers with a
37,000-strong work force.

Waste Management Proposes to Acquire Republic Services for

$34.00 Per Share in Cash




HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 14, 2008
Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WMI) announced today that it has made
a proposal to the Board of Directors of Republic Services, Inc.
(NYSE:RSG) (""Republic"") to acquire all of Republic's outstanding
common stock for $34.00 per share in cash. Waste Management's proposal
represents a premium of approximately 22% over the closing price of
Republic stock on July 11, 2008, the last trading day prior to public
disclosure of Waste Management's proposal.

   David P. Steiner, Waste Management's CEO, said, ""Our $34.00 per
share all-cash proposal clearly offers a better and more certain value
alternative to Republic stockholders than the recently announced
Republic-Allied Waste Industries, Inc. (""Allied"") transaction. We
believe our proposal is a superior proposal.""

   At a minimum, the Waste Management proposal should allow
Republic's Board to determine that this proposal could reasonably be
expected to lead to a transaction that is more favorable to Republic's
stockholders than the Republic-Allied merger and is reasonably capable
of being completed on a timely basis, as contemplated by the
Republic-Allied merger agreement. This determination by Republic's
Board will allow Waste Management to begin discussions with Republic
and would permit Republic to grant Waste Management access to its
information.

   Mr. Steiner continued, ""We look forward to a prompt determination
from Republic's Board and to initiating cooperative efforts to bring
our proposal to Republic's stockholders. The proposal also represents
a strategic and unique opportunity that will serve the interests of
Waste Management's stockholders. The combination is highly
complementary and fits well with Waste Management's strategy and
primary financial goals of earnings growth, margin expansion, strong
cash flow generation and increasing our long-term return on invested
capital. Based on publicly available information, we expect the
transaction to be accretive to earnings in the first year and to
deliver synergies of at least $150 million. We are confident we will
identify additional synergies once we're able to conduct our due
diligence.

   ""In addition, our Board is committed to maintaining our investment
grade status and continuing our annual dividend of $1.08 per share.

   ""Our industry is extremely competitive and capital intensive. So,
it is very important to achieve operational efficiencies and to
improve route density and asset utilization in order to deliver
superior service to our customers and higher returns to our
stockholders. We believe that the complementary combination of our
respective assets, coupled with the operational strengths of each
company, will enable the combined company to achieve greater
operational efficiencies than either company could achieve on its own.

   ""Based on the track record of each company, we expect the combined
entity will have the systems and processes in place to maximize
operational efficiencies. These include the ability to improve
efficiencies through collection routing and disposal integration, to
optimize fleet maintenance, to make continued progress toward world
class safety performance, and to leverage the shared services and
procurement organizations; all of which should contribute to
significant cost savings. We remain committed to achieving our
sustainability goals, which include increasing the amount of landfill
gas-to-energy that we produce and increasing the amount of recyclables
we manage. Republic's assets will augment our ability to attain these
goals,"" added Mr. Steiner.

   Waste Management Proposal is Superior

   Waste Management noted that the Republic-Allied merger agreement
expressly contemplates alternative proposals from third parties and
defines a process for Republic to respond to those proposals. Under
the terms of the Republic-Allied merger agreement, Republic's Board of
Directors is free to share Republic information, and engage in
discussions and negotiations with a party proposing an alternative
transaction, if the Board determines that it ""constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal,"" as defined in
the merger agreement.

   Mr. Steiner said, ""Obviously it is quite important that we be
given access to Republic information to assist on financing and
antitrust fronts and so that we can identify additional synergies and
other benefits of the merger. We are encouraged that the
Republic-Allied merger agreement expressly permits Republic's Board to
grant us access. We look forward to working with Republic to complete
a transaction that will create enhanced shareholder value for both
Republic and Waste Management stockholders.""

   Regulatory Approvals

   Waste Management is very experienced with the regulatory aspects
related to this proposed transaction. The proposal provided to the
Republic Board directly addresses the antitrust issues and concretely
demonstrates the Company's confidence that these issues can and will
be dealt with in an effective and timely manner. Among other things,
Waste Management is prepared to assume the responsibility and the
associated risks of divesting assets necessary to comply with its 1999
consent decree with the Department of Justice. In this regard, Credit
Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (""Credit Suisse"") has agreed to assist
Waste Management with any required divestitures. Credit Suisse
believes, based on recent contacts with industry participants, that
these assets will attract significant buying interest. Waste
Management also believes that, even with these divestitures, the
proposed transaction is a compelling and significant addition to its
business. The Company believes that a transaction with Republic would
close early in 2009.

   Financing

   Waste Management believes that all of the financing needed to
complete the transaction will be available on satisfactory terms.
Waste Management fully expects that, pro forma for the acquisition of
Republic, the Company will maintain its investment grade status. Waste
Management believes it will maintain investment grade status due in
part to the rating agencies' favorable view of the solid waste
industry on a relative basis; its leading role in the industry; the
enhanced scale and diversity that will result from the merger; its
strong capitalization and commitment to maintain an investment grade
rating; its plan to use net proceeds from divestitures and a
significant portion of the excess cash flow to pay down debt; and
comparison of the combined companies' credit metrics to criteria
generally used by the rating agencies to determine credit ratings.
Credit Suisse has advised Waste Management's Board of Directors that
subject to due diligence, market conditions and other circumstances,
it is highly confident it can arrange the financing for the
transaction that the Company is proposing. The Company is beginning
the process of obtaining commitment letters for financing with the
assistance of Credit Suisse.

   The proposal was unanimously approved by the Waste Management
Board of Directors. Below is the full text of the letter that Waste
Management sent to the Republic Board of Directors.

    July 14, 2008

    Board of Directors
    Republic Services, Inc.
    c/o James E. O'Connor
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
    110 S.E. 6th Street, 28th Floor
    Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33301

    Dear Jim and other members of the Board,

    Each of you should be very proud of the great company you created.
     As a result of your hard work and dedication, your assets and
     people are among the best in the business, and that is why on
     behalf of Waste Management, Inc. (""WMI"") and our Board of
     Directors, I am pleased to submit this proposal for WMI to
     acquire Republic Services, Inc. (""Republic""). We have followed
     the proposed merger between Republic and Allied Waste Industries,
     Inc. (""Allied"") since your June 13, 2008 public announcement
     confirming your merger discussions. We believe our proposal
     outlined below provides superior and certain value to Republic's
     stockholders in a market environment where the value to
     Republic's stockholders of the proposed transaction with Allied
     has been and may continue to be subject to considerable
     uncertainty.

    Our Board of Directors has unanimously authorized us to propose an
     alternative transaction in which WMI would acquire all of
     Republic's outstanding common stock at a price of $34.00 per
     share in an all-cash merger. This price represents an approximate
     22% premium to Republic's closing stock price on July 11, 2008.

    Our proposal is based on public information regarding Republic. In
     order to confirm our assumptions and to determine if there may be
     other benefits from the combination, we need access to the same
     type of information provided to Allied. Your agreement with
     Allied allows you to provide such access. We stand ready to begin
     our due diligence process immediately, and request that Republic
     give us access in accordance with the Republic-Allied merger
     agreement. We expect to be able to complete our due diligence
     review promptly so that we can quickly execute a merger
     agreement.

    Our financial advisor, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (""Credit
     Suisse""), will lead our financing program and stands ready to
     devote the time and resources necessary to put together promptly
     a full financing package for our proposal. Credit Suisse has
     advised our Board of Directors that subject to due diligence,
     market conditions and other circumstances, it is highly confident
     it can arrange the financing for the transaction we are
     proposing. The completion of due diligence should allow our
     financing sources to issue commitment letters with respect to the
     financing, which would be provided to Republic prior to the
     execution of the merger agreement.

    The transaction would be structured as a cash merger that would
     require the approval of Republic's stockholders, but not the
     approval of our stockholders. We contemplate entering into a
     merger agreement with Republic on terms similar to those
     contained in the Republic-Allied merger agreement, including the
     termination fee provision. Of course, we will need to make
     modifications related to converting to an all-cash acquisition.
     In addition, as discussed below, our agreement would include
     provisions with respect to antitrust matters that we believe
     would be more favorable to Republic than those in the Republic-
     Allied merger agreement. Subject to the satisfactory completion
     of our confirmatory due diligence and finalization of the terms
     of a merger agreement with Republic, we would be prepared,
     immediately upon the termination of the Republic-Allied merger
     agreement, to enter into a merger agreement that would provide
     greater and more certain value to your stockholders than that
     offered by the Republic-Allied merger.

    We have conducted an antitrust review of the combination of our
     two companies and considered the issues that might be presented.
     We are fully prepared to assume the responsibility (and
     associated risks) of divesting assets that are determined by the
     Department of Justice and the respective State Attorneys General
     to be necessary to comply with our 1999 consent decree pursuant
     to which Republic acquired certain WMI assets. We also recognize
     that such regulatory authorities may seek other divestitures or
     other relief, and we are prepared to address the other
     divestitures and relief in the same way Republic and Allied deal
     with those issues under the Republic-Allied merger agreement. We
     are confident that, with access to the information necessary to
     finalize our antitrust plan, all regulatory requirements will be
     met in a timely manner. Credit Suisse has agreed to assist WMI
     with any required divestitures. Credit Suisse believes, based on
     recent contacts with industry participants, that these assets
     will attract significant buying interest. We believe that the
     proposed transaction between WMI and Republic would close in
     early 2009.

    We expect to have a WMI closing condition in our merger agreement
     relating to maintaining investment grade status similar to the
     Republic closing condition in the Republic-Allied merger
     agreement. We are quite confident that we will maintain
     investment grade status given the rating agencies' favorable view
     of the solid waste industry on a relative basis; our leading role
     in the industry; our enhanced scale and diversity that will
     result from the merger; our strong capitalization and commitment
     to maintain an investment grade rating; our plan to use net
     proceeds from divestitures and a significant portion of excess
     cash flow to pay down debt; and a comparison of the combined
     companies' credit metrics to criteria generally used by the
     rating agencies to determine credit ratings.

    As you know, it was necessary to communicate our proposal to you
     by letter because of the provisions of Republic's merger
     agreement with Allied. Once Republic's Board makes the
     determination required by Section 6.02 of the Republic-Allied
     merger agreement, we look forward to the opportunity to speak to
     you and your representatives about our proposal and its
     implementation.

    We are confident that after you have considered our proposal you
     will agree that its terms are significantly more attractive to
     your stockholders than the Allied transaction. We believe our
     proposal is a superior proposal. We think you will agree that, at
     a minimum, our proposal ""could reasonably be expected to lead to
     a Superior Proposal,"" as defined in the Republic-Allied merger
     agreement. That determination will allow Republic to provide us
     access to information and to commence discussions with us with
     respect to our proposal. We respectfully request that you make
     this determination as soon as possible. We stand ready to sign a
     confidentiality agreement with Republic. This is a non-binding
     proposal that is subject to the contemplated execution of a
     definitive merger agreement.

    We have engaged Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and K&L
     Gates LLP as legal counsel to advise us in this transaction. We
     and our financial and legal advisors are prepared to move forward
     immediately with our proposal and are prepared to devote our full
     efforts and resources to pursue this transaction on an expedited
     basis.

    We believe that our proposal presents a compelling opportunity for
     your stockholders and I look forward to discussing the
     combination of our two great companies at your earliest
     convenience.

                                               Sincerely,

Abbott To Sell Its Core Laboratory Diagnostics Business,


Including Point Of Care, To GE For $8.13 Billion


Abbott's Molecular Diagnostics and Diabetes Care Businesses to Remain Part of 
Abbott's Broad-Based Portfolio


    ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Jan. 18 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT)
today announced that it will sell its core laboratory diagnostics business
included in the Abbott Diagnostics Division and Abbott Point of Care (formerly
known as i-STAT) to GE for $8.13 billion in cash, resulting in approximately
$6 billion in after-tax proceeds.  Abbott's Molecular Diagnostics and Diabetes
Care (glucose monitoring) businesses are not part of the transaction and will
remain part of Abbott.

    Over the past several years, Abbott has made a number of acquisitions and
completed other strategic actions that have transformed the company and
positioned it for higher growth by strengthening the mix of its medical and
pharmaceutical portfolio toward innovation and technology-driven businesses in
emerging therapeutic areas.  These include: Knoll Pharmaceuticals in 2001,
TheraSense (blood glucose monitoring) in 2004, and Guidant's vascular business
and Kos Pharmaceuticals (a leader in lipid management medicines), both in
2006.  Additionally, Abbott spun off its hospital products business into a
separate NYSE-traded company named Hospira in 2004.

    ""The laboratory diagnostics market has changed considerably in the last
decade.  Innovation in this segment will be increasingly driven by automation,
system integration and a host of skills that GE can offer,"" said Miles D.
White, chairman and chief executive officer, Abbott.  ""As part of GE, Abbott's
core diagnostics and point-of-care businesses will be powerfully positioned to
sustain and extend their market success.""

    The sale of Abbott's core laboratory diagnostics business to GE is
expected to close in the first half of 2007 and is subject to customary
closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.

    The transaction is expected to be neutral to Abbott earnings per share in
2007, excluding specified items, and accretive thereafter.

    Abbott will conduct a special conference call with the investment
community and the media today at 5 p.m. Central time (6 p.m. Eastern time) to
provide an overview of the transaction.  The live webcast will be accessible
through Abbott's Investor Relations Web site at
http://www.abbottinvestor.com .  An archived edition of the call will be
available after 8 p.m. Central time (9 p.m. Eastern time).

the best interests of our stockholders,"" said Parks. ""At the same time, it is
business as usual for us as we continue to support our clients and partner
with them to build loyal, lasting relationships with their customers. Our

has a demonstrated track record of investing in and growing the firms it
acquires, will benefit our clients now and in the future.""

Air Products Committed to Completing Value-Enhancing Transaction

  PR Newswire

  LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa., Feb. 5

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa., Feb. 5 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Air Products (NYSE: APD)
today announced that it has made an offer to acquire Airgas, Inc. (NYSE: ARG)
for $60.00 per share in cash.  The offer was made in a letter to Airgas' Board
of Directors yesterday after the CEOs of the two companies had previously
discussed Air Products' interest in acquiring Airgas and after Air Products
had made two written offers, and these offers and Air Products' requests to
discuss them were rejected by Airgas.

At $60.00 per share, the offer provides a 38% premium to Airgas shareholders
based on yesterday's closing price of $43.53 and is 18% above Airgas' 52-week
high.  The total value of the transaction is approximately $7.0 billion,
including $5.1 billion of equity and $1.9 billion of assumed debt.  The
acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Air Products' earnings
per share on both a GAAP and cash basis, excluding expected one-time costs.

Air Products' offer fully values Airgas' complementary capabilities and
attractive long-term prospects.  Headquartered in Pennsylvania, the combined
company would be the largest industrial gas company in North America and one
of the largest in the world, with distinctive strengths across all geographies
and in all three distribution channels: packaged gases, liquid bulk and
tonnage.  A combination of the two companies would be financially and
strategically compelling, with substantial cost synergies of $250 million by
the end of year two, and the ability to accelerate growth both domestically
and internationally by leveraging Airgas' extensive U.S. sales force and
packaged gases skills on the foundation of Air Products' global presence and
infrastructure.

Air Products is fully committed to pursuing this transaction, and has secured
committed financing from J.P. Morgan to complete the offer.  Air Products is
prepared to make appropriate divestitures to address regulatory issues.

John E. McGlade, Air Products' chairman, president and chief executive
officer, said, ""This is an extremely compelling transaction with undeniable
strategic and industrial logic that would benefit shareholders, customers and
employees of both companies.  Bringing together these two highly complementary
companies would create substantial value.  We highly value the talented
operating team at Airgas, and believe they would benefit greatly from the
expanded opportunities and resources available to them as part of a larger and
stronger global U.S. company with significantly greater long-term growth
prospects than a stand-alone Airgas.  While we are disappointed that Airgas
has thus far prevented its shareholders from receiving a substantial premium
and immediate liquidity, we have repeatedly communicated to the Airgas Board
our willingness to improve our offer to reflect any incremental value they can
demonstrate.  While it remains our strong desire to reach an agreement with
Airgas on a friendly basis, we are fully committed to pursuing this
transaction and are prepared to take all necessary steps to complete it,
including making an offer directly to Airgas shareholders.""

Air Products' financial advisor for this transaction is J.P. Morgan Securities
Inc. and its legal advisors are Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP and Arnold &
Porter LLP.

The management of Air Products will host a conference call and live webcast
today, Friday, February 5, 2010 at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss this announcement.
 The company welcomes all members of the investment community to listen to the
call live by dialing (913) 312-0685 and providing the passcode 4248658. The
live webcast of the call can be accessed at www.airproducts.com.  An audio
replay of the call will be available after the call's conclusion and can be

U.S. and entering the passcode 4248658.

Below is the full text of the most recent letter from Air Products to Airgas:

February 4, 2010

Mr. Peter McCausland

Chairman, President and CEO

Airgas, Inc.

259 North Radnor-Chester Road, Suite 100

Radnor, PA 19087-5283

Dear Peter:

As you know, we have been trying for the last four months to engage Airgas in
friendly discussions regarding a business combination.  We are deeply
disappointed that you and your board have rejected out of hand two written
offers providing your shareholders substantial premiums.  In our prior
correspondence, we clearly and repeatedly stated our flexibility as to both
value and form of consideration, yet you have continued to refuse even to
discuss our offers.  Your unwillingness to engage has delayed the ability of
your shareholders to receive a substantial premium.  We remain committed to
completing this transaction, and we have therefore decided to inform your
shareholders of our offer to expedite the process.

Air Products is prepared to proceed with a fully financed, all-cash offer for
all Airgas shares at $60.00 per share, which reflects a premium of 38% to
Airgas' closing price today of $43.53 and 18% above its 52-week high.  In
addition to a substantial premium, Airgas shareholders will benefit from
immediate liquidity in an uncertain economic environment through an offer
which we believe fully values Airgas' complementary capabilities and long-term
growth prospects.  

Bringing together our complementary skills and strengths will create one of
the world's leading integrated industrial gas companies.  Combining Air
Products' global leadership in liquid bulk and tonnage gases with Airgas'
leadership in U.S. packaged gases will create the largest industrial gas
company in North America and one of the largest globally - a leader with
distinctive strengths and world-class competencies across all distribution
channels and geographies.  While we have a strong and profitable packaged gas
business in Europe and other key international markets, we do not have a
position in the U.S. packaged gas business where Airgas is the market leader.
 As part of this uniquely compelling combination, Airgas would be well
positioned to achieve higher growth than it could achieve on a stand-alone
basis.

We do not believe there are any significant financial or regulatory
impediments to your shareholders' timely realization of this substantial cash
premium.  We have secured committed financing from J.P. Morgan to complete the
offer and are committed to maintaining a robust capital structure.  We have
also thoroughly considered the regulatory issues related to this combination
and are prepared to make appropriate divestitures, none of which we expect to
be material.  

The strategic and industrial logic of this combination is clear, and we are
confident that an Air Products/Airgas combination would create greater value
than Airgas or Air Products could each achieve on its own.  There are many
advantages to consummating this combination now, including:

  * The opportunity to improve growth, returns and cash generation.
  * Substantial cost synergies, which are expected to yield savings of $250
    million annually when fully realized, primarily related to reductions in
    overhead and public company costs, supply chain efficiencies, and better
    utilization of infrastructure.
  * The ability to leverage Airgas' extensive U.S. sales force and packaged
    gases skills, and to build on the foundation of Air Products' global
    presence and infrastructure, to accelerate growth both domestically and
    internationally.
  * An integrated platform better able to capture economies of scale from
    extensive engineering, operations and back office capabilities with a much
    greater reach and ability to provide better overall customer service.
  * Air Products' presence in all of the world's key industrial gas markets,
    increased cash flow and greater access to capital would allow Airgas to
    achieve international expansion far faster and at a much lower cost, while
    accelerating its growth through acquisitions.

We believe the timing for this combination is ideal.  The economy is just
beginning to emerge from recession, and together we would be able to take full
advantage of the substantial growth potential, economies of scale, and
synergies unique to this transaction. You have made clear your international
growth aspirations, which will require significant time and expense to build
out on your own.  Air Products has the global infrastructure in place that
would allow you to achieve your goals faster and better.  Airgas is also just
in the initial stages of implementing SAP, and our demonstrated expertise in
this area would greatly reduce the time, expense and disruption associated
with this vital rollout.  

Bringing our two companies together would also benefit employees, customers
and the communities in which we operate.  We highly value the talented
operating team at Airgas, which would benefit greatly from the expanded
opportunities and resources available as part of a larger and stronger global
U.S. company headquartered in Pennsylvania -- with significantly greater
long-term growth prospects than a stand-alone Airgas.  Your customers would
benefit from a more robust product offering from a company with expanded
resources and global scope.

Peter, let me reemphasize as I have in past discussions that Air Products is
fully committed to the successful completion of this compelling transaction.
 Your continuing refusal to engage with us will serve only to further delay
your shareholders' ability to receive a substantial all-cash premium.  While
we would strongly prefer to proceed through friendly negotiations, you should
not doubt our resolve to take the necessary actions to complete this
transaction.  We would welcome the opportunity to meet with you or with any
special committee of your independent directors which has been or will be
formed to consider our offer, as well as their independent financial and legal
advisors.  Finally, we reiterate our willingness to reflect in our offer any
incremental value you can demonstrate.  

Very Truly Yours,

John E. McGlade

Business Wire

RALEIGH, N.C. -- December 12, 2011

Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) today announced that it has
delivered a proposal to Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) and commenced an
exchange offer to effect a business combination with Vulcan that would create
a U.S.-based company that is the global leader in construction aggregates with
a footprint reaching across North America. As of December 9, 2011, the
combined market capitalization was $7.7 billion and the combined total
enterprise value was $11.4 billion. The combined mineral reserves of the two
companies would be 28 billion tons.

Ward Nye, Martin Mariettas President and Chief Executive Officer said, The
combination of Martin Marietta and Vulcan is a compelling opportunity for both
companies shareholders, customers, employees and the communities we serve. By
bringing together our highly complementary assets, we have the opportunity to
create the global leader in aggregates, led by the best team in the industry,
drawn from both companies. The combined company will have one of the
industrys strongest balance sheets and, as we achieve expected synergies of
$200 to $250 million and continue to adhere to Martin Mariettas strict
operational and financial discipline, the company will be well positioned to
pursue a wide range of attractive growth opportunities and to continue
delivering value to shareholders.

We also intend to maintain the dividend for the combined company at Martin
Marietta's current rate of $1.60 per Martin Marietta share annually, or the
equivalent of $0.80 per Vulcan share annually, based on the proposed exchange
ratio. This dividend rate is 20 times Vulcans current level, said Mr. Nye.

The proposal, including the exchange offer, has the unanimous support of the
Martin Marietta Board of Directors. Under the terms of the exchange offer,
each outstanding share of Vulcan will be exchanged for 0.50 Martin Marietta
shares. The offer represents a premium for Vulcan shareholders of 15% to the
average exchange ratio based on the closing share prices for Vulcan and Martin
Marietta during the 10-day period ended December 9, 2011 and 18% to the
average exchange ratio based on the closing share prices for Vulcan and Martin
Marietta during the 30-day period ended December 9, 2011.

We are bringing our proposal directly to Vulcans shareholders after Vulcan
ceased participating in private discussions toward a negotiated transaction,
which commenced over a year and a half ago, Mr. Nye concluded.

Martin Mariettas proposal contemplates directors from both Martin Marietta
and Vulcan serving on the combined company's Board. Furthermore, it proposes
Don James, Vulcans Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, serve as Chairman of
the Board, and that Ward Nye serve as President and Chief Executive Officer,
with executives from both companies on the senior management team. Under the
proposal, the combined company would be headquartered in Raleigh, North
Carolina, where Martin Marietta is based, and maintain a major presence in
Birmingham, Alabama, where Vulcan is based.

Below is the full text of the letter that Martin Marietta today sent to
Vulcan:

December 12, 2011

Mr. Donald M. James

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Vulcan Materials Company

1200 Urban Center Drive

Birmingham, Alabama 35242

Dear Don:

More than a year and a half ago, you and I (and, on several occasions, members
of our senior management teams) began to explore the financial and strategic
merits and potential terms of a business combination of Vulcan Materials
Company (Vulcan) and Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (""Martin Marietta"").
Despite Martin Marietta's clear, continuing interest, some months ago Vulcan
disengaged from discussions. Martin Marietta continues to believe that a
strategic combination of our two companies is compelling financially and
operationally, and that such a combination presents our respective
shareholders with a significant value creation opportunity and brings great
benefits to our respective customers and employees.

Recent events, including the fragile state of the U.S. economy, the lack of
visibility as to when a sustainable recovery will take place, and the
uncertainty surrounding government spending on infrastructure projects, only
strengthen the rationale behind a combination. Combining our two complementary
companies makes excellent industrial sense and establishes a U.S.-based
company that is the global leader in our industry. The continued uncertainty
regarding the timing and level of recovery in the macroeconomic environment
underscores the immediate value your shareholders would receive in a business
combination with Martin Marietta, through the conversion of their Vulcan
investment into the stock of a more stable and financially sound combined
company that pays a meaningful dividend  equivalent to 20 times Vulcan's
current dividend per share. In addition, we believe your shareholders would
realize long-term value in a business combination with Martin Marietta from
the anticipated improvement in share price derived from the expected
significant synergies resulting from the combination of our companies.

Martin Marietta's Board of Directors is, and I personally am, disappointed
that despite these substantial benefits, Vulcan has been unwilling to move
ahead towards a definitive agreement. We believe our proposal is compelling
and transformative for the stakeholders of both Vulcan and Martin Marietta. In
light of Vulcans reluctance to consider further this value-enhancing
opportunity, Martin Mariettas Board of Directors has unanimously concluded
that the time has come to take steps intended to result in prompt and fair
consideration of our proposal on behalf of Vulcan's shareholders.

Let me provide you and your Board with the key aspects of our proposal:

  * We are proposing a stock-for-stock, tax-free transaction, in which each
    outstanding share of Vulcan common stock would be exchanged for 0.50
    shares of Martin Marietta common stock. This exchange ratio represents a
    premium for Vulcan shareholders of 15% to the average exchange ratio based
    on closing share prices for Vulcan and Martin Marietta during the 10-day
    period ended December 9, 2011 and 18% to the average exchange ratio based
    on closing share prices for Vulcan and Martin Marietta during the 30-day
    period ended December 9, 2011.
  * We are proposing a combined company board, with you as Chairman of the
    Board.
  * We are proposing a senior management team that would consist of me as
    President and Chief Executive Officer and other senior leaders from each
    organization based on a best athlete approach.
  * We are proposing to maintain a major presence in Birmingham.
  * We are proposing to change the name of the combined company to reflect the
    names of each of our respective organizations.

The proposed transaction will, in our view, provide important benefits for
both companies stakeholders  investors, employees, and the customers we
serve  that will be particularly valuable in the current uncertain economic
climate:

  * Substantial Cost Synergies. We anticipate significant cost synergies
    ranging from $200 million to $250 million, derived from a combination of
    operating efficiencies and elimination of duplicate functions. These are
    savings that would benefit all shareholders and customers of the combined
    company. Vulcans shareholders would participate in the value created by
    these synergies as well as best-in-class financial performance. In
    addressing cost synergies, your Board and shareholders should be aware
    that we are using our estimates, which are realistic and achievable under
    our disciplined and responsible cost management philosophy, and are quite
    a bit higher than your estimates of synergies. We believe our consistent
    cost management leadership within our industry underscores the credibility
    of our estimates. For example, from 2007 to the third quarter of 2011,
    Martin Mariettas SG&A as a percent of revenue has declined from 8.0% to
    7.9%, while Vulcans has increased from 9.3% to 12.0%.
  * Complementary Geographic Footprints / Global Aggregates Leader. The
    combination of complementary geographic footprints will create a
    U.S.-based company that is the clear global leader in aggregates, and will
    result in a company that can deliver enhanced product offerings and
    service to customers. The combined company would have an outstanding asset
    base that will create value for its shareholders over both the short and
    long term. Among other things, greatly increased scale provides a broader
    set of opportunities for organic and inorganic growth. From our
    understanding of the market, it is fair to say that any asset dispositions
    necessary to support regulatory approvals could be readily accomplished on
    a fast timeline given the likely interest from various buyers. Moreover,
    our recent asset swap that resulted in the disposition of our River assets
    reduces regulatory concerns.
  * Strong Financial Position. The combined company will have a significantly
    stronger balance sheet than Vulcan currently possesses. The combined
    company's net debt would be 5.6x combined LTM adjusted EBITDA, excluding
    synergies, and 4.1x  4.3x combined LTM adjusted EBITDA, including
    synergies of $200 million  $250 million, as of September 30, 2011,
    relative to Vulcan's net debt of 8.9x LTM adjusted EBITDA, as of the same
    date. This would help Vulcan to achieve one of its core objectives 
    enhanced financial flexibility through deleveraging. We expect the
    combined company credit rating to be higher than Vulcan's is at present.
  * Improved Cash Flows / Meaningful Dividend. Finally, because the proposed
    transaction is being structured as a tax-efficient, stock-for-stock
    transaction, the combined company will have significant cash flow, giving
    it the ability to pay a meaningful quarterly cash dividend. Indeed, it is
    our objective to maintain the dividend at Martin Mariettas current rate
    ($1.60 per Martin Marietta share annually, equivalent to $0.80 per Vulcan
    share annually, based on the proposed exchange ratio). In light of
    Vulcan's recent decrease in its dividend (to $0.04 per Vulcan share
    annually), we believe Vulcan's shareholders will find this aspect of the
    proposal attractive.

We believe the substantial overlap between the shareholders of Martin Marietta
and Vulcan will reinforce the benefit from the value-creating combination of
our two companies. Further, we believe that Martin Marietta and Vulcan
employees would benefit from the greater scale and strength of the combined
company.

In connection with delivering this proposal letter, we are taking the
following additional steps:

  * We are providing you with a proposed transaction agreement that sets forth
    in additional detail the terms described in this proposal letter.
  * We are commencing a first-step exchange offer, reflecting the same
    exchange ratio as provided in the transaction agreement. This exchange
    offer, subject to the conditions specified therein, will give Vulcan
    shareholders the opportunity to exchange their shares at the earliest time
    for Martin Marietta shares.
  * We are advising you of Martin Marietta's intention to submit the names of
    five nominees (the ""Nominees"") for election as independent directors at
    Vulcan's 2012 Annual Meeting, and accordingly are requesting from Vulcan's
    Secretary the written questionnaire, and the written representation and
    agreement, referenced in Section 1.05 of Vulcan's By-Laws.
  * Earlier today, Martin Marietta commenced a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery
    Court and in New Jersey state court in furtherance of its effort to ensure
    that Vulcan's shareholders have the opportunity to assess directly Martin
    Marietta's proposal.

Please know that it remains our strong preference to execute this transaction
on a negotiated basis with Vulcan's current Board of Directors. In furtherance
of this approach, my team and I are prepared to engage immediately with the
Vulcan team. In addition, we and our advisers, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.,
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, are
prepared to begin immediately the process of negotiating a definitive
agreement. We believe that we can complete due diligence, negotiate a
definitive agreement and obtain final Martin Marietta Board approval quickly.
We are prepared to provide reciprocal due diligence to Vulcan.

This letter and the accompanying transaction agreement are not binding and do
not represent or create any legally binding or enforceable obligations. No
such obligations will be imposed on either party unless and until a definitive
agreement is signed by Martin Marietta and Vulcan.

As analysts and industry observers have long speculated, our two companies are
highly complementary and a combination makes a great deal of strategic and
financial sense  and we agree. It is our hope that you and your Board will
carefully evaluate the financial and operational benefits of this now-public
proposal and elect to engage in a productive dialogue with us so that,
together, we can execute this very compelling strategic business combination
with minimal disruption.

Should you have any questions concerning this proposal, I would be pleased to
speak with you at any time.

Sincerely,

C. Howard Nye

Marietta and Vulcan; the volatility of fuel costs, particularly diesel fuel,
and the impact on the cost of other consumables, namely steel, explosives,
tires and conveyor belts; continued increases in the cost of other repair and
supply parts; transportation availability, notably barge availability on the
Mississippi River system and the availability of railcars and locomotive power
to move trains to supply Martin Marietta's and Vulcan's long haul distribution
markets; increased transportation costs, including increases from higher
passed-through energy and other costs to comply with tightening regulations as
well as higher volumes of rail and water shipments; availability and cost of
construction equipment in the United States; weakening in the steel industry
markets served by Martin Marietta's dolomitic lime products; inflation and its
effect on both production and interest costs; Martin Mariettas ability to
successfully integrate acquisitions and business combinations quickly and in a
cost-effective manner and achieve anticipated profitability to maintain

  Share in Cash and Stock

           Combination Would Create Nations Largest Hospital Chain

   $7.3 Billion Transaction Would Provide 40% Premium to Tenet Shareholders

Business Wire

FRANKLIN, Tenn. -- December 09, 2010

Community Health Systems, Inc. (NYSE: CYH) (CHS) today announced that it has
made an offer to acquire Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE: THC) for $6.00
per share, including $5.00 per share in cash and $1.00 per share in CHS common
stock, which represents a premium of 40% over Tenets closing stock price
today. In addition to receiving a substantial cash premium, Tenet shareholders
would share in the upside of the combined company through the stock portion of
the consideration.

The total value of the transaction would be approximately $7.3 billion,
including $3.3 billion of equity and approximately $4 billion of net debt. The
offer was made in a letter to Tenets Board of Directors on November 12, 2010,
and rejected by Tenet on December 6, 2010. CHS today sent another letter to
the Tenet Board (see below).

The combination of CHS and Tenet would be both financially and strategically
compelling. The combined company would have approximately $22 billion in pro
forma annual revenue and own or operate 176 hospitals in 30 states with a
total of 32,830 licensed beds. The acquisition of Tenet is expected to be
accretive to CHSs earnings per share in the first full year after closing,
excluding one-time costs.

CHS has a reputation for superior operating performance and a successful track
record of integrating acquisitions. CHS believes the complementary fit of the
two companies, the geographic proximity of their facilities, and the ability
to enhance the operating efficiencies and best practices of a combined
organization would enable it to provide even higher quality care for patients
and broader and more effective services to the communities it serves.

CHSs financial advisor is Credit Suisse and its legal advisor is Kirkland &
Ellis LLP.

CHS will hold a conference call to discuss this press release on Friday,
December 10, 2010, at 9:30 a.m. Central, 10:30 a.m. Eastern time. Investors
will have the opportunity to listen to a live internet broadcast of the
conference call by clicking on the Investor Relations link of the Companys
website at www.chs.net, or at www.earnings.com. To listen to the live call,
please go to the website at least fifteen minutes early to register, download
and install any necessary audio software. For those who cannot listen to the
live broadcast, a replay will be available after the call and will continue
through January 10, 2011.

Below is the full text of the letter sent today by CHS to Tenet:

 
December 9, 2010
 
Board of Directors
Tenet Healthcare Corporation
1445 Ross Avenue
Dallas, Texas 75202
 
Attention:       Mr. Trevor Fetter
                 President and Chief Executive Officer
                  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We were surprised and disappointed by your flat rejection of a transaction
that would provide a premium of approximately 40% to Tenet Healthcare
Corporation shareholders. As you know, Community Health Systems, Inc. (CHS)
has offered to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Tenet at a price of
$6.00 per share ($5.00 in cash and $1.00 in CHS stock). We are convinced this
transaction would be very attractive to Tenet shareholders  and we do not
understand how you could state in your letter of December 6 that our proposal
does not offer even remotely fair value to Tenet shareholders.

Given your position, we have concluded it is now appropriate to publicly
disclose our proposal. This will allow Tenet shareholders to decide for
themselves if they prefer the substantial premium and high degree of certainty
offered in this transaction  or would rather continue to accept the
significant risk, especially in light of recent operating performance, that
Tenet can achieve greater present value for shareholders through execution of
its strategic plan in the years ahead.

The combination of CHS and Tenet is both financially and strategically
compelling. At $6.00 per share, our proposal provides a 40% premium over
Tenets closing stock price today which is materially higher than the average
premium paid in similar size transactions over the last five years. In
addition to receiving a substantial cash premium, Tenet shareholders will
share in the upside of the combination through the stock portion of the
consideration, which will be based on a fixed exchange ratio. The total value
of the transaction would be approximately $7.3 billion.

CHS is the nations largest publicly traded hospital company and a leading
operator of general acute care hospitals in non-urban and mid-size markets
across the country, with a reputation for superior operating performance and a
successful track record of acquisitions. The complementary fit of our two
companies, the geographic proximity of our facilities, and the ability to
enhance the operating efficiencies and best practices of a combined
organization would enable us to provide even higher quality care for our
patients and broader and more effective services to the communities we serve.
For physicians, the breadth and strength of the combined company would offer
attractive practice opportunities. With expanded scale and market reach, the
combined company would also be well positioned to effectively navigate
healthcare reform.

The combined company would have approximately $22 billion in annual revenue
and own or operate 176 hospitals in 30 states with a total of 32,830 licensed
beds. The combined companys facilities would be diversified across urban and
non-urban markets.

CHS has an extremely successful acquisition and integration track record, most
notably evidenced by our acquisition of Triad Hospitals in 2007, and has
demonstrated expertise in achieving large-scale transactional and operational
synergies. We expect this acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per
share in the first full year, excluding one-time costs.

It remains our strong desire to reach an agreement with Tenet. However, we are
committed to completing this transaction and will consider all alternatives
necessary to do so. Our proposal is based on our analysis of publicly
available information. As we have made clear to your advisors, we would
welcome the opportunity to review any additional information you provide and
are prepared to recognize any additional value you can demonstrate.

We do not believe there are any financial or regulatory impediments to your
shareholders timely realization of this substantial premium. The cash portion
of the consideration would be financed with available cash on hand together
with external debt financing. We have analyzed this combination in detail with
our financial advisors at Credit Suisse and are highly confident that we can
deliver a fully financed transaction. Prior to the execution of the definitive
transaction agreements, we anticipate receiving financing commitments in an
amount sufficient to fund the transaction. We have conducted a preliminary
antitrust review and do not believe the combination would give rise to any
significant antitrust issues. In addition, we do not expect the transaction
would require approval by CHS shareholders.

This transaction is a strategic priority for us and has the full attention of
our management team and the unanimous support of our Board of Directors.
Accordingly, we and our financial and legal advisors at Credit Suisse and
Kirkland & Ellis LLP are prepared to devote the resources necessary to
complete our due diligence activities and negotiate and execute mutually
acceptable definitive documentation in an expedited manner.

I want to reiterate CHSs commitment to successfully completing this
compelling transaction. By refusing to negotiate with us, you are delaying
your shareholders ability to receive the substantial financial and strategic
benefits of this transaction. We stand ready to meet with you and your
advisors to move this transaction forward without further delay.

Sincerely,

Wayne T. Smith
Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer

    Preliminarily Estimated to Create Synergies with a Net Present
    Value of Approximately $2.5 Billion and Offers Compelling Value
              Proposition to Leap Wireless' Shareholders


DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 04, 2007
MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (NYSE: PCS), the nation's leading
provider of unlimited wireless communications service for a flat rate
with no signed contract, today announced that it has sent a letter to
Leap Wireless International, Inc. (NASDAQ: LEAP) proposing a strategic
stock-for-stock tax-free merger that will create a fifth national
wireless carrier. Under the terms of the proposal, each outstanding
share of Leap common stock would be exchanged for 2.7500 shares of
MetroPCS common stock.

   --  Based on MetroPCS' trailing 20-day volume-weighted average
        stock price as of August 31, 2007, the proposed exchange ratio
        implies a value of $77.89 for each share of Leap common stock,
        or approximately $5.5 billion in aggregate equity value.
        MetroPCS also will assume or refinance approximately $2.0
        billion of Leap's existing indebtedness.

   --  The proposed exchange ratio represents implied premiums of
        23.1% and 20.1% based on the trailing 20-day and the trailing
        60-day volume-weighted average stock prices, respectively, for
        both companies for the period ending August 31, 2007.

   --  In addition, based on preliminary analysis, MetroPCS believes
        the proposed combination could result in synergies with an
        estimated net present value of approximately $2.5 billion,
        which, if achieved, would represent significant further value
        to Leap's shareholders of approximately $12.34 for each share
        of Leap common stock.

   --  When considered together, the total value implied by the
        proposed exchange ratio and Leap's shareholders' proportionate
        share of the estimated transaction synergies, which MetroPCS
        believes could be achieved, represents implied premiums of
        approximately 35.1% and 30.3% based on the trailing 20-day and
        the trailing 60-day volume-weighted average stock prices,
        respectively, for both companies for the period ending August
        31, 2007.

   --  MetroPCS believes that since its initial public offering in
        April of this year, Leap's stock price has traded in part in
        anticipation of a merger between the two companies.
        Accordingly, MetroPCS believes that any calculation of the
        premiums represented by its proposal over Leap's spot or
        trailing volume-weighted average trading prices on selected
        days or for selected periods necessarily understates the value
        to Leap's shareholders of MetroPCS' proposal in terms of
        premium-to-unaffected market stock price.

   ""We believe that the combination of MetroPCS and Leap is extremely
compelling and will create significant value for the stakeholders of
both companies,"" said Roger D. Linquist, MetroPCS' Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer. ""The combined company will create a
new national wireless carrier with licenses covering nearly all of the
top 200 markets in the United States. The shareholders of both
companies will have the opportunity to participate in the upside
potential of the combined company and our respective employees will
benefit from being a part of a larger, more diversified organization.
We are excited about the prospects this opportunity creates and plan
to work diligently to enter into a transaction quickly.""

   J. Braxton Carter, MetroPCS' Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer, added: ""Based on the analyses that we have
performed to date, we believe that there are substantial operational
synergies achievable from this proposed transaction. Importantly,
MetroPCS and Leap shareholders would own approximately 65.4% and
34.6%, respectively, of the combined company, allowing them to benefit
proportionately from the significant upside resulting from the
enhanced operating and financial performance of the combined company.""

   More specifically, MetroPCS believes that the combined company
would achieve meaningful operating cost savings through a combination
of market-level operating efficiencies and corporate overhead
reductions. MetroPCS' and Leap's existing market operations are
complementary and MetroPCS believes that the combined company, as a
result of the expanded service area, would likely benefit from
incremental improvements in customer penetration and retention. Based
on preliminary analysis, MetroPCS believes that the net present value
of these opportunities could be approximately $2.5 billion.

   In light of the compelling reasons for a combination of MetroPCS
and Leap, and the importance of allowing the companies' respective
shareholders to capitalize on the benefits of the proposed transaction
sooner rather than later, MetroPCS released the following letter
publicly so that both companies' stakeholders will have the
opportunity to fully assess this unique opportunity:

Dr. Mark H. Rachesky, M.D.
Chairman of the Board

Mr. S. Douglas Hutcheson
President and Chief Executive Officer

Leap Wireless International, Inc.
10307 Pacific Center Court
San Diego, CA 92121

Gentlemen:

We believe a combination of Leap Wireless and MetroPCS is compelling
and would yield substantial immediate benefits to the shareholders of
both companies. Institutional shareholders of both of our companies as
well as the Wall Street research community repeatedly have articulated
their desire to see a business combination between our two companies
announced before the end of 2007. MetroPCS has carefully considered
these views and believes that such a combination would generate
substantial value for both companies' shareholders and other
stakeholders. Accordingly, we are pleased to submit for your
consideration this proposal for a strategic stock-for-stock tax-free
merger between MetroPCS and Leap. We encourage you to join with us to
capitalize promptly on this unique opportunity to enhance value for
all of our shareholders.

Specifically, we propose a stock-for-stock tax-free merger in which
each outstanding share of Leap common stock would be exchanged for
2.7500 shares of MetroPCS common stock. Based on MetroPCS' trailing
20-day volume-weighted average stock price as of August 31, 2007, the
proposed exchange ratio implies a value of $77.89 for each share of
Leap common stock, or approximately $5.5 billion in aggregate equity
value. In addition, MetroPCS will assume or refinance approximately
$2.0 billion of Leap's existing indebtedness. On a pro forma net
diluted basis, MetroPCS and Leap shareholders would own approximately
65.4% and 34.6%, respectively, of the combined company. Both MetroPCS
and Leap shareholders will benefit from the significant upside
resulting from the enhanced operating and financial performance of the
combined company, and our collective shareholders will benefit from
greater liquidity in the stock market for their common stock and
improved access to the overall capital markets.

We believe that the rationale for a merger of MetroPCS and Leap is
both compelling and straight forward:

    --  First and most important, the combination of our two companies
        would create a new national wireless carrier with licenses
        covering nearly all of the top 200 markets in the United
        States. Such a combination would significantly expand the
        network service area available to the subscribers of both
        companies and would better position the combined company to
        more aggressively compete with the other national wireless
        carriers.

    --  Second, based on our preliminary analysis, we believe that the
        combined company would achieve significant operating cost
        savings through a combination of market-level operating
        efficiencies and corporate overhead reductions. MetroPCS' and
        Leap's existing market operations are complementary, and we
        believe that the combined company, as a result of the expanded
        service area, would likely benefit from incremental
        improvements in customer penetration and retention. Based on
        our preliminary analysis, we believe that the net present
        value of these opportunities could be approximately $2.5
        billion.

    --  Third, based on our preliminary analysis, we believe that the
        merger of MetroPCS and Leap may result in additional
        operational and financial benefits, which could provide
        additional value to our respective shareholders. The cost of
        customer acquisition (or CPGA) as well as capital expenditures
        may benefit on a combined basis from increased volume
        purchasing power with key handset and equipment manufacturers.
        The combined company would also have opportunities to more
        efficiently utilize all of the spectrum assets that we
        currently hold.

    --  Finally, we believe the combined company, as a true national
        wireless carrier, would be better positioned strategically in
        the rapidly evolving United States wireless industry.

We believe that the proposed combination of MetroPCS and Leap creates
a highly attractive value proposition for our respective shareholders.
Specifically, for Leap's shareholders, the following are key economic
aspects of the contemplated merger:(1)

    --  Based on MetroPCS' trailing 20-day volume-weighted average
        stock price as of August 31, 2007, the proposed exchange ratio
        implies a value of $77.89 for each share of Leap common stock,
        or approximately $5.5 billion in aggregate equity value.

    --  The proposed exchange ratio represents implied premiums of
        23.1% and 20.1% based on the trailing 20-day and the trailing
        60-day volume-weighted average stock prices, respectively, for
        both companies for the period ending August 31, 2007.

    --  In addition, based on preliminary analysis, we believe the
        proposed combination could result in synergies with an
        estimated net present value of approximately $2.5 billion,
        which, if achieved, would represent significant further value
        to Leap's shareholders of approximately $12.34 for each share
        of Leap common stock.

    --  When considered together, the total value implied by the
        proposed exchange ratio and Leap's shareholders' proportionate
        share of the estimated transaction synergies, which MetroPCS
        believes could be achieved, represents implied premiums of
        35.1% and 30.3% based on the trailing 20-day and the trailing
        60-day volume-weighted average stock prices, respectively, for
        both companies for the period ending August 31, 2007.

    --  We believe that since our initial public offering in April of
        this year, Leap's stock price has traded in part in
        anticipation of a merger between the two companies.
        Accordingly, we believe that any calculation of the premiums
        represented by our proposal over Leap's spot or trailing
        volume-weighted average trading prices on selected days or for
        selected periods necessarily understates the value to Leap's
        shareholders of our proposal in terms of premium-to-unaffected
        market stock price.

A combination of MetroPCS and Leap also will afford us the opportunity
to combine the skills of each of our talented workforces. We see great
opportunities for the employees of Leap to join our team. Employees of
the combined company would benefit from being part of a larger, more
diversified organization that is better positioned to compete on a
national scale.

The Board of Directors and senior management of MetroPCS are excited
about the proposed merger with Leap and are prepared to move very
promptly to undertake the necessary due diligence and negotiate and
finalize a transaction. Together with our financial advisor, Bear,
Stearns & Co. Inc., and our legal advisors, Baker Botts LLP, Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker
LLP, we stand ready to commence and promptly complete reciprocal due
diligence and simultaneously negotiate a mutually acceptable
definitive merger agreement containing customary representations,
warranties, covenants, closing conditions and other provisions for two
public companies of our stature.

Neither this letter nor any oral or written proposal shall be deemed
in any way to constitute an offer of securities, an offer to exchange
securities or a binding agreement by MetroPCS to enter into a
definitive merger agreement pursuant to the terms and conditions of
such letter or proposal. Such binding agreement, if any, shall only be
reflected by a mutually acceptable definitive merger agreement entered
into after negotiations between MetroPCS and Leap and after approval
by our respective Boards of Directors. Of course, the execution of any
definitive merger agreement between MetroPCS and Leap also would be
subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence, and the
consummation of any merger would be subject to the approval by our
respective shareholders and the receipt of customary regulatory
approvals (which we believe can be obtained relatively quickly because
of our minimal operating market overlap). By moving expeditiously to
enter into a definitive merger agreement, we would expect that this
proposed transaction could close in the Spring of 2008.

We believe that the time is right to bring our companies together, and
we trust that Leap's Board of Directors will determine to pursue this
truly unique merger opportunity that so clearly and significantly will
benefit our respective shareholders. Given the compelling strategic
rationale of the combination, we believe it is important to our
collective shareholders that we work together to reach an agreement
quickly in order to gain the benefits of the combined company.
Accordingly, we look forward to your prompt response to this proposal.

Sincerely,

/s/Roger D. Linquist
Roger D. Linquist
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

Statement regarding approach

  

The Board of Informa plc (""Informa""  or the ""Company"") notes the  recent press
speculation regarding the approach made by Providence Equity LLP, The  Carlyle
Group and Hellman & Friedman (the ""Consortium""). 

The Company confirms that a  proposal was made to the  Board of Informa on  26
June 2008 at a  price of 506  pence per Informa  ordinary share. The  proposed
price assumes that no dividends or  other distributions are declared and  paid
subsequent to the final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2007.

Discussions continue to be  at an early  stage and there  can be no  certainty
that an offer will be made.

This announcement is made without the approval of the Consortium and therefore
there can be no certainty as to the terms as to which any offer will be made. 

A further announcement will be made in due course.

Dealing disclosure requirements

Under the provisions of  Rule 8.3 of  the Takeover Code  (the ""Code""), if  any
person is, or becomes, ""interested"" (directly or indirectly) in 1% or more  of
any class of ""relevant securities"" of Informa, all ""dealings"" in any ""relevant
securities"" of Informa (including by  means of an option  in respect of, or  a
derivative referenced to,  any such  ""relevant securities"")  must be  publicly
disclosed by no later than  3.30 pm (London time)  on the London business  day
following the date of the relevant transaction. This requirement will continue
until the date on which any offer becomes, or is declared, unconditional as to
acceptances, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn  or on which the ""offer  period""
otherwise ends. If two or more  persons act together pursuant to an  agreement
or understanding,  whether formal  or informal,  to acquire  an ""interest""  in
""relevant securities"" of Informa,  they will be deemed  to be a single  person
for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Under the provisions  of Rule  8.1 of the  Code, all  ""dealings"" in  ""relevant
securities"" of Informa by any potential offeror or Informa, or by any of their
respective ""associates"", must be disclosed by no later than 12.00 noon (London
time)  on  the  London  business  day  following  the  date  of  the  relevant
transaction.

A disclosure  table,  giving  details  of the  companies  in  whose  ""relevant
securities"" ""dealings"" should be disclosed, and the number of such  securities
in   issue,    can    be   found    on    the   Takeover    Panel's    website
at www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk.

""Interests in securities"" arise, in summary,  when a person has long  economic
exposure, whether  conditional  or  absolute,  to  changes  in  the  price  of
securities. In particular, a person will be treated as having an ""interest"" by
virtue of the ownership or control of  securities, or by virtue of any  option
in respect of, or derivative referenced to, securities.

Terms in quotation marks are defined in  the Code, which can also be found  on
the Panel's website.  If you are  in any doubt  as to whether  or not you  are
required to disclose a ""dealing"" under Rule 8, you should consult the Panel.

UNIONDALE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 17, 2006
Reckson Associates Realty Corp. (NYSE: RA) confirmed today that it
had received a proposal from Rome Acquisition Limited Partnership, a

for all of Reckson outstanding shares is based solely on public
information and is subject to due diligence. A copy of the letter will
be filed by Reckson with the SEC under a Form 8-K.

   Reckson's Board has determined by a vote of its independent
directors and in accordance with the terms of its existing merger
agreement with SL Green Realty Corp. to engage in discussions with
Messrs. Macklowe and Icahn with respect to their proposal to determine
whether a transaction on the terms specified in the letter can be
consummated and have offered to enter into a confidentiality agreement
with Rome. Reckson cautioned that these discussions may be terminated
at any time and that there can be no assurances as to whether the Rome
proposal will ultimately result in a transaction with Reckson at
either the price set forth in the Rome proposal or otherwise. Reckson
noted that its shareholders meeting is scheduled for Wednesday,
November 22, 2006 and the Reckson Board, by a vote of its independent
directors, has reaffirmed its recommendation of Reckson's pending
merger with SL Green. The Reckson Board is determined to move promptly

implications of the Rome proposal with respect to the scheduled
shareholders meeting.

London, 2 March 2007

                                 EMI Group plc

EMI Group plc (""EMI"" or the ""Company"") announces that it has received a
non-binding proposal from Warner Music Group (""WMG"") indicating that WMG might
be prepared to make an offer, pre-conditional on regulatory clearance, of 260
pence per share in cash for EMI, subject to numerous assumptions and
conditions.

At a regular Board meeting of EMI held earlier today, WMG's proposal was
considered by the Board which concluded that it is not in the best interests of
EMI shareholders to entertain a pre-conditional offer which would entail
prolonged regulatory uncertainty and unacceptable operational risk at a
critical time for the Company. The Board also regards a price of 260 pence per
share as inadequate, having regard to the stand-alone value of EMI, the
synergies available from a combination with WMG and the risks identified above.

There can be no certainty that the approach by WMG will lead to an offer being
made for the Company or as to the terms on which any offer might be made. As
required by The Takeover Code, EMI confirms that this announcement is not being
made with the agreement or approval of WMG.

EMI remains focused on maximising the performance of the business including
implementation of the restructuring programme announced on 12 January 2007.

Dealing Disclosure Requirements

Under the provisions of Rule 8.3 of the Takeover Code (the ""Code""), if any
person is, or becomes, ""interested"" (directly or indirectly) in 1% or more of
any class of ""relevant securities"" of the Company, all ""dealings"" in any
""relevant securities"" of the Company (including by means of an option in
respect of, or a derivative referenced to, any such ""relevant securities"") must
be publicly disclosed by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the London
business day following the date of the relevant transaction. This requirement
will continue until the date on which the offer becomes, or is declared,
unconditional as to acceptances, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn or on which
the ""offer period"" otherwise ends. If two or more persons act together pursuant
to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire an
""interest"" in ""relevant securities"" of the Company, they will be deemed to be a
single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Under the provisions of Rule 8.1 of the Code, all ""dealings"" in ""relevant
securities"" of the Company by WMG or the Company, or by any of their respective
""associates"", must be disclosed by no later than 12.00 noon (London time) on

securities"" ""dealings"" should be disclosed, and the number of such securities
in issue, can be found on the Takeover Panel's website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk.

""Interests in securities"" arise, in summary, when a person has long economic
exposure, whether conditional or absolute, to changes in the price of
securities. In particular, a person will be treated as having an ""interest"" by
virtue of the ownership or control of securities, or by virtue of any option in
respect of, or derivative referenced to, securities.

Terms in quotation marks are defined in the Code, which can also be found on
the Panel's website. If you are in any doubt as to whether or not you are
required to disclose a ""dealing"" under Rule 8, you should consult the Panel.

        Triad Shareholders to Receive $50.25 Per Share in Cash

                  Transaction Valued at $6.4 Billion


PLANO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 05, 2007
Triad Hospitals, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Triad"") (NYSE: TRI) today
announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with
affiliates of CCMP Capital Advisors (""CCMP Capital"") and GS Capital
Partners (""GSCP"") in a transaction valued at approximately $6.4
billion, including approximately $1.7 billion of debt.

   Under the terms of the agreement, affiliates of CCMP Capital and
GSCP will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Triad common stock
for $50.25 per share in cash.

   Triad's Board of Directors, on the unanimous recommendation of a
Special Committee composed entirely of disinterested directors, has
approved the agreement and recommends that Triad stockholders approve
the merger. All disinterested members of the Board voted in favor of
the agreement, with the two inside directors abstaining.

   James D. (Denny) Shelton, Triad Chairman and CEO, said, ""After
thorough and extensive analysis, the Special Committee and our Board
have endorsed this transaction with CCMP Capital and GSCP as being in
the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The decision
to take the Company private is the culmination of a strategic planning
process initiated several months ago to explore the various options
available to the Company to enhance shareholder value. We are pleased
that this transaction appropriately recognizes the importance of
Triad's collaborative approach to working with the many constituencies
that we serve while providing our stockholders with a cash premium for
their investment in Triad. CCMP Capital and Goldman Sachs are
experienced investors in healthcare services, with a solid
understanding of the opportunities and challenges that face Triad
today. They will be supportive shareholders of the Company, and we
look forward to working closely with them in the years ahead.""

   Stephen Murray, Managing Director with CCMP Capital, said, ""Triad
is an exceptional company, with a clear vision and a strong commitment
to its patients, physicians and employees. CCMP Capital and Goldman
Sachs share this vision and commitment.""

   Adrian Jones, Managing Director with GSCP, said, ""We are excited
by the opportunity to work with Triad management. Denny and his team
have built a superb company over the past seven years, and have
developed an innovative growth plan, including partnerships with
not-for-profit hospitals, that we will fully support.""

   The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions,
including the approval of Triad's stockholders, regulatory approvals
and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. There is
no financing condition to consummate the transaction. The transaction
is expected to close promptly following the satisfaction of all
closing conditions.

   Under the merger agreement, Triad may solicit superior proposals
from third parties during the next 40 days. To the extent that a
superior proposal solicited during this period leads to the execution
of a definitive agreement, Triad would be obligated to pay a $20
million break-up fee to CCMP Capital and GSCP and reimburse up to $20
million of their out-of-pocket expenses. In accordance with the
agreement, the Board of Directors of Triad, through its Special
Committee and with the assistance of its independent advisors, intends
to solicit superior proposals during this period. Triad advises that
there can be no assurance that the solicitation of superior proposals
will result in an alternative transaction. During the 40-day period,
CCMP Capital and GSCP do not have a contractual right to be advised of
or match the terms of any superior proposal.

   The Company expects to hold a Special Meeting of Stockholders to
consider and vote on the proposed merger and merger agreement, among
other things. Accordingly, Triad will postpone its 2007 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders pending the outcome of the Special Meeting.

   Dewey Ballantine LLP is acting as legal advisor to Triad. Lehman
Brothers Inc. is acting as financial advisor and delivered a fairness
opinion to the Special Committee, and Baker Botts L.L.P. is acting as
the Special Committee's legal advisor.

   Goldman, Sachs & Co., JP Morgan, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
are acting as financial advisors and O'Melveny & Myers LLP is acting
as legal advisor to CCMP Capital and GSCP.

THE MCGRAW-HILL COMPANIES INC (""MHP-BHDNPX3"")
- MGIC Investment Corp., Radian Group Inc., And Subs
- Ratings Unaffected By Announced Merger

    Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said that its ratings on MGIC
Investment Corp. (A/Stable/A-1) and Radian Group Inc. (A/Stable/--) and
their respective subsidiaries are not affected by their announcement that
they intend to merge.

    MGIC is the holding company for several 'AA' rated mortgage insurance
companies. Radian is also the holding company for several 'AA' rate
mortgage insurers as well as Radian Asset Assurance Inc. (AA/Stable/--), a
financial guarantor offering both direct financial guaranty insurance in
certain niche market sectors and reinsurance capacity. When the transaction
is complete, the combined entity will be the largest industry player by
far, significantly changing the playing field for all U.S. mortgage
insurers.

    Standard & Poor's believes there is a good strategic fit between MGIC
and Radian Group in the mortgage insurance sector. We also believe the
merger will create a combined entity and an enhanced competitive position
in the mortgage insurance sector. These positive factors are balanced by
the operational risk inherent in any substantial merger. Successful
integration could lead to the outlook on the mortgage insurance operating
companies and the holding company being revised to positive in a couple of
years, depending on the firm's operating performance and the industry's
long-term fundamentals.

    More information on the effect of this merger on the U.S. mortgage
insurance industry is available in an article titled ""U.S. Mortgage
Insurers Expected To Remain Strong Following The MGIC/Radian Merger,"" which
was published today on RatingsDirect, Standard & Poor's Web-based credit
analysis system, at www.ratingsdirect.com.

 Open Strategic Alternatives Process to Continue in Order to Solicit Superior
                            Alternative Proposals

Business Wire

HOUSTON -- December 15, 2010

Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) today announced that its Board of Directors has
unanimously approved a definitive agreement to be acquired by Icahn
Enterprises LP (NYSE: IEP) in a tender offer followed by a merger for $5.50
per share in cash, or approximately $665 million in the aggregate. Dynegy has
approximately $3.95 billion of outstanding debt, net of cash.

Under the terms of the agreement, Dynegy stockholders will receive $5.50 in
cash for each outstanding share of Dynegy common stock they own, which is
$0.50 per share or 10% higher than the previous offer and represents a 10%
premium to Dynegys average closing stock price over the last 30 trading days.
In connection with todays announcement, it is expected that a wholly owned
subsidiary of IEP will commence a tender offer for all of the outstanding
shares of Dynegy that they do not already own no later than December 22, 2010.
IEP and its affiliates own approximately 9.9% of Dynegys outstanding shares
and have previously acquired options to purchase approximately 5% of Dynegys
outstanding shares. IEP has also agreed that, in certain circumstances, if a
superior all cash offer is made and supported by Dynegy, and IEP does not
wish to top the superior offer, it will support it.

Open Strategic Alternatives Process

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Dynegy will continue its ongoing open
strategic alternatives process, during which Dynegy will solicit superior
proposals until 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on January 24, 2011. Prior to the
execution of the merger agreement, Dynegys financial advisors had already
commenced soliciting interest from a significant number of strategic and
financial buyers, and other interested third parties are invited to contact
Dynegys financial advisors. It is not anticipated that any developments will
be disclosed with regard to this process unless Dynegys Board of Directors
makes a decision with respect to any potential superior proposal. There are no
guarantees that this process will result in a superior proposal. The Special
Committee of Dynegys Board will continue to oversee the open strategic
alternatives process.

Bruce A. Williamson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dynegy
Inc., said, We believe the IEP offer, coupled with our continued ability to
solicit superior proposals and the commitment of IEP to support a company
accepted all cash offer for 100% of the Company, is a very positive outcome
for all Dynegy stockholders.

Carl C. Icahn stated: All stockholders should benefit from the auction
process which has now begun at a price which is 10% higher than the last bid.

Closing Conditions

Completion of the transaction is conditioned on, among other things,
satisfaction of the minimum tender condition that at the close of the tender
offer, IEP and its affiliates own at least 50% of Dynegys shares and receipt
of regulatory approvals. Following receipt of the minimum condition, a merger
will be effected so that a subsidiary of IEP will be merged into Dynegy and
holders of Dynegys outstanding common stock will receive $5.50 per share,
subject to appraisal rights. In the event the minimum condition is not met,
and in certain other circumstances, the parties have agreed to complete the
transaction through a one-step merger after receipt of stockholder approval.
If no superior proposal is received during the open strategic alternatives
process and the tender offer is successfully completed, Dynegy expects the
transaction to close in the first quarter of 2011.

Advisors

Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Greenhill & Co., LLC are serving as financial
advisors and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP is serving as legal counsel to Dynegy.

 - Excellent business fit brings leading market positions in corn value chain
                                   to Bunge

     - Adds high-value starches and sweeteners to Bunge product portfolio

      - Complementary global asset networks create growth and efficiency
                                opportunities


    WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. and WESTCHESTER, Ill., June 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/
-- Bunge Limited (NYSE: BG) and Corn Products International, Inc. (NYSE: CPO)
today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement in which
Bunge will acquire Corn Products in an all-stock transaction. The aggregate
transaction value is approximately $4.8 billion, including assumption of
approximately $414 million of Corn Products' net debt.

    Under the terms of the agreement, approved by the Boards of Directors of
both companies, Corn Products stockholders will receive common shares of Bunge
with a market value of $56.00 for each share of Corn Products common stock
that they own, subject to adjustment as described below. Following the closing
of the transaction, Corn Products stockholders will own approximately 21% of
Bunge's fully diluted shares.

    ""Combining with Corn Products provides a unique opportunity for Bunge to
establish an integrated, global presence in the corn value chain, which is
highly complementary to our existing operations,"" stated Alberto Weisser,
Bunge Limited's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""Corn Products is the
leading pure-play franchise in corn refining and will add higher-margin starch
and sweetener products to Bunge's product portfolio, expand our operations in
important growth markets, and diversify our revenue stream with a solid cash
flow business.""

    Sam Scott, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Corn
Products International, said, ""I am excited by this combination. It represents
a terrific opportunity to create value for our stockholders, enhance
opportunities for our employees and provide benefits to our global partners
and customers. Our stockholders will have an ongoing equity interest in a
combined company that is well-positioned to serve customers around the world
with a broad product portfolio, integrated distribution network and innovative
products.""

    Upon closing of the transaction, Corn Products will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Bunge, and Mr. Scott will join Bunge's Board of Directors.


    Commercial, Geographic and Operational Opportunities

    The combination of Bunge and Corn Products will create a larger, more
diversified and competitive global provider of agribusiness and food products.

    -- Enhanced product portfolio: By adding Corn Products' value-added
sweeteners, starches and other ingredients to Bunge's portfolio of
agribusiness, fertilizer, edible oil and milling products, the combined
company will be well positioned to serve growing global demand for a broad
array of agribusiness and food products. The global market for sweeteners and
starches is growing at approximately 5% per year.

    -- Stronger presence in attractive geographies: The combination brings
together the companies' established strengths in core geographies, including
the U.S., Brazil and Argentina. It also provides opportunities to build on
each other's asset networks to expand in high growth geographies, such as
China, Mexico, India, South America, Southeast Asia and Africa.

    -- Complementary customer bases: By creating common and more efficient
distribution channels and improved sales and product development capabilities,
the combined company will be able to increase its presence in shared customer
segments, such as processed food, bakery, animal feed and brewing, while
serving a larger and more diverse set of customers overall.

    -- Financially compelling: Bunge expects to achieve estimated annual cost
synergies and incremental profit opportunities of $100 million to $120
million, including savings in areas such as procurement, logistics and
elimination of duplicate costs. Additionally, the all-stock transaction
strengthens the company's balance sheet for future growth.



    Mr. Weisser continued: ""Corn Products has all the right elements -- a
culture that mirrors Bunge's, a rich heritage of providing high quality
products, proven financial success and a customer-focused mindset. We look
forward to welcoming Corn Products' talented global team to Bunge and working
together to create value for our shareholders, customers and employees.""

    After the combination of Bunge's and Corn Products' global operations,
Bunge will have approximately 32,000 employees and operations in 40 countries.
Neither company expects the closure of any industrial facilities as a result
of this transaction. Following the closing, Corn Products will maintain its
operational headquarters in Westchester, Ill., continue its ongoing
commitments to the local communities in which it operates and continue to use
the Corn Products brand name.

    In 2007, Bunge reported net income of $778 million and generated total
segment EBIT of $1,230 million. During the same period, Corn Products reported
net income of $198 million and operating income of $347 million.

    Separately, today Bunge also announced an increase in its 2008 annual
earnings guidance.


    Transaction Details

    Under the terms of the agreement, each share of Corn Products common stock
will be exchanged for a fraction of a common share of Bunge determined by
dividing $56.00 by the volume weighted average closing price of a Bunge common
share on the New York Stock Exchange for the 15 trading days ending on the
second trading day prior to the date of the Corn Products stockholders
meeting, provided that if this average closing price is equal to or greater
than $133.10, each share of Corn Products common stock will be exchanged for
0.4207 of a Bunge common share, and if this average closing price is equal to
or less than $108.90, each share of Corn Products common stock will be
exchanged for 0.5142 of a Bunge common share.

    The exchange of shares in the transaction is expected to qualify as a tax-
free reorganization, allowing Corn Products stockholders to defer any gain on
their shares for U.S. income tax purposes.

    The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2008 and is
subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt
of regulatory clearances, as well as approval by the shareholders of both
companies.

    Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated
are acting as financial advisors to Bunge and Shearman & Sterling LLP is
serving as legal advisor. Lazard is acting as financial advisor to Corn
Products, and Sidley Austin LLP is serving as legal advisor. J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. also provided a fairness opinion to the Board of Corn
Products.

By Jim Polson
     Aug. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Blackstone Group LP agreed to
acquire Dynegy Inc., the Texas power producer that lost 94
percent of its market value in the past three years, for more
than $540 million.
     Owners of Houston-based Dynegy will get $4.50 in cash for
each of their shares, 62 percent higher than yesterdays close,
the seller said today in a statement. The agreement allows
Dynegy to pursue a better offer.
     Blackstone, the worlds largest buyout firm, also agreed to
assume Dynegys debt, bringing the acquisitions total value to
about $4.7 billion. Power producer NRG Energy Inc. said it
agreed to pay Blackstone $1.36 billion for Dynegy plants in
California and Maine. Dynegy also has plants in the U.S. Midwest
and Northeast, which may become more valuable for Blackstone as
recovering industrial power demand lifts energy prices.
     Blackstone may want to buy the assets relatively cheap
and be able to flip them at very nice profits in a short time,
said Daniele Seitz, an analyst at Dudack Research Group in New
York. Dynegy has already invested millions of dollars to bring
plants into compliance with environmental regulations, she said.
     The Dynegy takeover is contingent on Blackstones closing
the asset sale to NRG at the same time. Dynegy said the sale
agreement gives it 40 days to solicit alternative offers.

                      Texas Plant Purchase

     Separately, Princeton, New Jersey-based NRG said its also
buying a plant in eastern Texas from Kelson LP for $525 million.
     Dynegy jumped to $4.53 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Blackstone fell 38 cents, or 3.5
percent, to $10.63. NRG dropped 45 cents, or 2 percent, to
$21.96.
     The Blackstone deal is priced 66 percent below Dynegys 52-
week high of $13.35, reached in October. The stock traded at an
eight-year low yesterday. Since announcing a 1-for-5 reverse
stock split on April 2, Dynegy has plunged 55 percent.
     Its been on a race to the bottom, said Paul Patterson,
an analyst at Glenrock Associates in New York. The market
hasnt been particularly enthusiastic about independent power
producers recently, and Blackstone obviously sees some value.
     Dynegy shareholders should take money and run on the
Blackstone deal, Houston investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt &
Co. said today in a note to clients. The firm said it cant
see anyone else stepping up to make a competing bid.

                          Buyout Binge

     Dynegy spokesman David Byford and Peter Rose of New York-
based Blackstone declined to comment beyond the statement
announcing the deal.
     The pace of leveraged buyouts is accelerating amid a
recovering economy. Buyouts have jumped almost sixfold from this
time last year to $51.7 billion in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Thats still a fraction of the $365.4
billion in deals done during 2007s first half, at the peak of
the buyout boom. Leveraged deals stalled after the 2008 collapse
of financial markets.
     Including assumed debt, the Dynegy takeover is the largest
acquisition for Blackstone since its purchase of Hilton Hotels
Corp., announced in 2007. The transaction is scheduled to close
by the end of this year, Dynegy said.
     NRGs plant purchases will add natural-gas-fueled
generation capacity at about 40 percent to 50 percent of the
cost of building the power stations, Tudor Pickering said.

                           NRG Plants

     The power stations are ideally located, filling in gaps
in three core regions for NRG, David Crane, the companys chief
executive officer, said in a statement. NRG is the second-
largest power producer in Texas. It sells power under contracts
for so-called base-load electricity that customers need
regardless of whether demand is high or low.
     Its a good deal for them, just because right now, they
are almost exclusively a base-load power provider in Texas,
said Neel Mitra, an analyst at Simmons & Co. International in
Houston. This deal diversifies their geographic exposure as
well as their operating profile.
     Dynegy said it was advised by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Greenhill & Co. Sullivan & Cromwell LLP was legal adviser.
Credit Suisse Group AG advised Blackstone, and Simpson Thacher &
Bartlett LLP was its legal counsel.

ROCHESTER, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 05, 2007
Bausch & Lomb (NYSE:BOL) announced today that it has received from
Advanced Medical Optics (NYSE:EYE) a proposal (the ""AMO Proposal"") to
acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Bausch & Lomb in a merger in
which Bausch & Lomb's shareholders would receive, per share of Bausch
& Lomb stock, $45.00 in cash and $30.00 in AMO stock, valued based on
the average closing price of the AMO common stock for five trading
days prior to the date (if any) on which a definitive agreement is
signed.

   The AMO Proposal is subject to termination of Bausch & Lomb's
previously announced merger agreement with affiliates of Warburg
Pincus LLC (""Warburg Pincus"") (the ""Warburg Pincus Agreement"") and the
execution of a definitive merger agreement with AMO. The AMO
Proposal's terms include that AMO will have up to 12 months to close
the transaction and that interest would be paid in cash with respect
to the purchase price by AMO at the rate of 7.2% per annum beginning
six months after a definitive merger agreement is executed. The
proposal is not subject to a financing condition. AMO has submitted a
financing commitment letter in connection with the proposal. The AMO
Proposal is conditioned upon, among other things (1) approval by AMO's
shareholders and Bausch & Lomb's shareholders, (2) regulatory
approvals and (3) certain additional due diligence by AMO. The AMO
Proposal includes (1) a proposed $130 million reverse termination fee
payable by AMO to Bausch & Lomb in the event the transaction does not
close due to the failure to obtain requisite financing or antitrust
clearance and (2) proposed reimbursement by AMO of Bausch & Lomb's
expenses up to $35 million if AMO fails to obtain the approval of its
shareholders. The AMO Proposal provides for (1) a proposed $130
million termination fee payable under certain circumstances by Bausch
& Lomb to AMO in the event of termination of an agreement with AMO in
connection with the exercise by the Bausch & Lomb Board of Directors
of its fiduciary duties and (2) a proposed reimbursement of AMO's
expenses up to $35 million under the same circumstances in which such
expenses are reimbursable under the Warburg Pincus Agreement.

   The Bausch & Lomb Board of Directors, following the recommendation
of a Special Committee composed entirely of independent directors, has
determined that the AMO Proposal is bona fide and is reasonably likely
to result in a superior proposal, as defined in the Warburg Pincus
Agreement. AMO has therefore been designated an ""excluded party"" as
defined in the Warburg Pincus Agreement. By designating AMO an
excluded party, Bausch & Lomb is permitted, subject to certain
conditions, to continue negotiating with AMO with respect to the AMO
Proposal despite the end of the ""go shop"" period.

   The Special Committee and its advisors intend to engage in further
discussions with AMO regarding the AMO Proposal. Bausch & Lomb
cautioned that the AMO Proposal is subject to a number of
contingencies which the Special Committee is continuing to evaluate,
including the requirement of approval by AMO's shareholders as well as
antitrust clearances, and that there could be no assurance that the
Special Committee would ultimately find the proposal to be a superior
proposal under the merger agreement. Bausch & Lomb cautioned that the
discussions with AMO may be terminated at any time and that there can
be no assurances as to whether the AMO Proposal will ultimately result
in a transaction with Bausch & Lomb. AMO is the only ""excluded party""
designated by the Special Committee.

   As announced on May 16, 2007, Bausch & Lomb entered into the
Warburg Pincus Agreement, pursuant to which Warburg Pincus agreed to
acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Bausch & Lomb for $65.00 per
share in cash. The Warburg Pincus Agreement may be terminated under
certain circumstances, including if Bausch & Lomb receives and enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal and
provides advance notice to Warburg Pincus. If the Warburg Pincus
Agreement is terminated under these circumstances with respect to an
excluded party such as AMO, Warburg Pincus will be entitled to a $40
million payment from Bausch & Lomb.

   Pending further discussions with AMO, Bausch & Lomb's Board of
Directors, following the recommendation of the Special Committee of
the Board of Directors, has not changed, and has reaffirmed, its
recommendation of Bausch & Lomb's pending merger with affiliates of
Warburg Pincus pursuant to the Warburg Pincus Agreement.

     Combination Is Natural Development in Companies' Successful,
            Seven-Year-Long Relationship around ERBITUX(R)


NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 31, 2008
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) today announced that it
has proposed to enter into an agreement to acquire ImClone Systems
Incorporated (NASDAQ: IMCL), a global leader in the development and
commercialization of novel antibodies to treat cancer, for $60.00 per
share in cash, or a total payment of approximately $4.5 billion, to
equity holders of ImClone, other than Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Bristol-Myers Squibb currently owns approximately 17 percent of all
outstanding shares of ImClone.

   Bristol-Myers Squibb's all-cash offer, which is not conditioned on
the receipt of financing or on the conduct of due diligence,
represents a premium of approximately 30 percent over ImClone's
closing stock price on July 30, 2008, the last trading day before
Bristol-Myers Squibb sent its proposal to ImClone's Board of
Directors, a premium of approximately 40 percent over the average
closing price of ImClone's stock during the most recent one-month
period and a premium in excess of 40 percent for the average closing
stock prices of ImClone stock during each of the most recent
three-month and 12-month periods.

   James M. Cornelius, chairman and chief executive officer,
Bristol-Myers Squibb, said, ""Our proposed acquisition of ImClone
represents an evolutionary development in our companies'
seven-year-long relationship, and is in the best interests of
Bristol-Myers Squibb and ImClone shareholders and employees, and the
patients we serve together. Bristol-Myers Squibb is the natural
partner for ImClone as we possess the knowledge base and resources to
advance the company's growth over the long-term, not only with respect
to ERBITUX(R), the important cancer therapy we jointly commercialize,
but also in terms of developing ImClone's pipeline assets. Our current
contractual relationship with ImClone, in which we hold exclusive,
long-term marketing rights to ERBITUX in the U.S., has been very
successful, and we believe that, by applying Bristol-Myers Squibb's
financial, R&D and marketing capabilities to support the product, we
will be able to reach an even broader patient population.""

   ""For Bristol-Myers Squibb, the proposed acquisition of ImClone
represents a strategically and financially sound add-on to our
business, consolidating a relationship we have had for nearly seven
years. The acquisition is expected to contribute to our financial
performance in the 2012-2013 timeframe as well as drive growth beyond
2013,"" continued Mr. Cornelius.

   ""Bristol-Myers Squibb is prepared to proceed to work with
ImClone's Board of Directors quickly and efficiently to reach a
definitive merger agreement regarding our all-cash offer, which
delivers full and fair value to ImClone's shareholders. We look
forward to meeting with ImClone's Board and management to effect this
transaction in an expedited manner,"" concluded Mr. Cornelius.

   ERBITUX (cetuximab) is indicated for use in the treatment of
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and for use in the
treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
Bristol-Myers Squibb and ImClone have been engaged in the
co-development and co-commercialization of ERBITUX in the U.S. and
Canada under an agreement entered into in September 2001. Under the
agreement, ImClone receives a distribution fee based on a flat rate of
39 percent of net sales in North America. This Agreement was amended
in July 2007 to provide for additional development funding for certain
indications. The Agreement expires in September 2018 with respect to
ERBITUX in the U.S.

   Bristol-Myers Squibb and ImClone have also been engaged in the
co-development of ERBITUX in Japan with Merck KGaA since December
2004. In October 2007, the three companies amended this agreement to
provide for co-commercialization of ERBITUX in Japan. The companies
received marketing approval for ERBITUX in Japan on July 16, 2008, for
use in combination with irinotecan to treat unresectable advanced or
recurrent colorectal cancer.

   Bristol-Myers Squibb's proposal to acquire ImClone for $60.00 per
share in cash was conveyed earlier this morning by Mr. Cornelius to
Carl C. Icahn, chairman of the Board of Directors of ImClone, and
confirmed in a letter sent to the Board of Directors. The full text of
the letter follows:

Dear Carl:

This confirms that Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is offering to enter
 into an agreement to acquire ImClone Systems Incorporated for $60 per
 share in cash. Our all-cash offer represents a premium of
 approximately 30% over the closing price of ImClone common stock on
 July 30, 2008, a premium of approximately 40% over the one-month
 average closing price of ImClone common stock, and a premium in
 excess of 40% over the three-month and one-year average closing
 prices of ImClone common stock. A full combination of BMS and ImClone
 is a natural fit for both our companies, and we are convinced our
 proposed price represents a full and fair offer for ImClone.

For nearly seven years, BMS and ImClone have worked in concert to
 bring ERBITUX(R) to patients and build a strong product. We value our
 commercial agreement with ImClone and believe our respective
 commercial teams have forged an excellent working relationship. We
 also value our interactions with your scientists and clinicians. We
 have high regard for the potential of ImClone's pipeline assets,
 while recognizing the early stage of their development and the
 significant investment which is required to further their
 development.

Our Board of Directors has approved this offer. We and our advisors
 are prepared to meet with you and your advisors to answer any
 questions you may have about our offer. We are confident that, with
 ImClone's cooperation, we can reach a definitive agreement very
 quickly. We do not foresee any regulatory or other impediment to
 closing. Our offer is not conditioned on financing or due diligence.

As you know, as a result of our current ownership of ImClone stock, we
 are subject to U.S. securities laws which require us to disclose any
 material change in our intentions with respect to ImClone as
 reflected in our Schedule 13D on file with the U.S. Securities and
 Exchange Commission. Accordingly, we are filing with the SEC an
 amendment to our Schedule 13D disclosing our offer and including this
 letter as an exhibit.

In my view, and in the view of our Board of Directors, this
 transaction makes compelling business sense for both of our companies
 and is in the best interests of our respective shareholders and the
 cancer patients for whom our companies' life saving medicines are so
 important. The price we are offering represents an extremely
 attractive opportunity for the shareholders of ImClone to realize
 today the future value of the company. Our desire is to conclude a
 transaction which is enthusiastically supported by you and all other
 members of the ImClone Board. We look forward to your prompt response
 to our offer.

                                                            Sincerely,

                                                /s/ James M. Cornelius

Billion In Convertible Preferred Securities And $1 Billion In Cash




UNIONDALE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 04, 2006
Reckson Associates Realty Corp. (NYSE: RA) confirmed today that it
received a letter from American Real Estate Partners, L.P. (""AREP""),
an entity 90% owned by Carl Icahn, which was faxed to the Company's
representatives early this morning, following the notification that
Reckson received over the weekend that Harry Macklowe and Mack Cali
had determined not to proceed with an offer for Reckson. The letter
sets forth a proposal from AREP to acquire Reckson for consideration
consisting of $1 billion in cash and $3.3 billion in a new class of
AREP Preferred Units, which would carry a 5% dividend payment and be
convertible into AREP Depositary Units at $104.50 per Depositary Unit.
A copy of the letter will be filed by Reckson on a Schedule 8-K. The
letter states that, if the Preferred Units are valued at par, it would
constitute a proposal to acquire Reckson at $49 per share in total
consideration.

   Reckson cautioned that there are a number of uncertainties and
potential contingencies associated with the letter it just received
that will need to be further evaluated. Reckson further cautioned that
since this letter appears to constitute a new proposal from a new
""Person"" within the meaning of the SL Green merger agreement, none of
the prior determinations that were made by the Reckson Board under the
SL Green merger agreement with respect to the prior Rome proposal
(which formed the basis for engaging in discussions with Rome and
providing it access to due diligence information), would appear to be
applicable to the recently received AREP letter. Reckson indicated
that the Reckson Board of Directors will therefore need to review the
AREP letter with its legal and financial advisors in accordance with
the terms of the Company's pending merger agreement with SL Green
before determining what, if any, discussions are appropriate with AREP
with respect to the newly received letter.

   Reckson is subject to a binding merger agreement with SL Green. As
stated in the Reckson press release issued last night, the Reckson
Board, by a vote of its independent directors, has reaffirmed its
recommendation of Reckson's pending merger with SL Green.

   Important Information and Where to Find It

   Reckson and SL Green have filed a definitive proxy
statement/prospectus as part of a registration statement regarding the
proposed transaction with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
on October 19, 2006. Investors and security holders are urged to read
the proxy statement/prospectus because it contains important
information about SL Green and Reckson and the proposed transaction.
Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the
definitive proxy statement/prospectus and other documents filed by SL
Green and Reckson with the SEC at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

   Combination Creates Premier Food & Specialty Beverage Packaging Company

               Investor Conference Call Today at 9:00 a.m. EDT

Business Wire

STAMFORD, Conn. -- April 13, 2011

Silgan Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: SLGN), a leading supplier of rigid consumer
goods packaging products, announced today it has entered into a definitive
merger agreement to acquire Graham Packaging Company Inc. (NYSE: GRM), a
leading global supplier of value-added rigid plastic containers for the food,
specialty beverage and consumer products markets.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, Graham shareholders will receive 0.402
shares of Silgan common stock and $4.75 in cash for each share of Graham
common stock, representing a total enterprise value, including net debt, of
approximately $4.1 billion. Based on Silgans closing stock price on April 12,
2011, the transaction implies a value of $19.56 per Graham share, representing
a premium over the closing price of Grahams stock on April 12, 2011 of
approximately 17 percent.

This acquisition creates the premier Food and Specialty Beverage packaging
company, allowing Silgan to significantly broaden its ability to serve these
important markets with multiple rigid packaging options, said Tony Allott,
Silgan's President and Chief Executive Officer. Graham Packaging is a
differentiated plastic packaging franchise with deep customer relationships
and a strong track record for innovation. In combination, we anticipate
building enhanced relationships with global customers in our target end
markets, continued Mr. Allott.

Silgan and Graham share a common operational discipline focused on returns on
capital and cash flow generation. This acquisition will provide significant
cost synergies, while efficiently utilizing the debt capacity of our balance
sheet, continued Mr. Allott. As a result, we believe this combination will
drive significant shareholder value creation, concluded Mr. Allott.

The combined company has annual sales of over $6.2 billion, and its over
17,000 employees will operate 180 manufacturing facilities in 19 countries.

Highlights of the transaction:

  * Market Focus: Following the transaction, Silgan will be a world leader in
    food and specialty beverage packaging, with combined revenues of
    approximately $4.6 billion serving these end markets which are
    characterized by stable demand with large, growing multi-national
    customers.
  * Financial Impact: Silgan expects the transaction to be accretive to
    earnings and cash flow per share in the first full year. Following the
    acquisition, on a pro forma basis Silgan expects to generate approximately
    $500 million in free cash flow, or approximately $5 per share, in the
    first full year of operations.
  * Committed Debt Financing: Pro forma for the transaction, Silgans leverage
    ratio will be approximately 4 times, which is consistent with past levels
    at Silgan. The transaction is supported by committed financing, with the
    permanent capital structure expected to consist of an optimal mix of bank
    facilities and bonds. Silgan has a longstanding track record of
    successfully operating with moderate levels of leverage, allowing for very
    attractive levered returns to shareholders.
  * Synergies: Silgan expects to realize operational cost synergies of $50
    million by the third year following the combination. These synergies will
    be achieved primarily through  reductions in administrative expenses,
    procurement savings and a more efficient manufacturing cost structure.

As a result of its strong reputation in the credit markets and anticipated
ratings profile, Silgan expects to achieve a very attractive cost of debt
capital, resulting in pro forma interest expense in line with current Silgan
and Graham combined levels, even after the incremental debt raised for the
cash portion of the acquisition consideration and transaction costs. Included
in these transaction costs is a cash payment at closing of $245 million
pursuant to contractual change in control provisions in Grahams Income Tax
Receivable agreements with certain affiliates. It is expected that the net
present value of cash tax savings Silgan will realize through the utilization
of Grahams net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes will
more than offset this payment.

This transaction has been unanimously approved by Silgans Board of Directors.
The transaction has also been unanimously approved by Grahams Board of
Directors based on the unanimous recommendation of its Special Committee. The
acquisition is currently expected to close in the third quarter of 2011,
subject to the approval of the transaction by Silgans shareholders and
Grahams shareholders, receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and the
satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Each of Silgans Co-Chairmen of
the Board, R. Philip Silver and D. Greg Horrigan, who collectively
beneficially own 29% of Silgans common stock, have entered into an agreement
to vote in favor of the transaction. Blackstone Capital Partners III L.P. and
certain of its affiliates and the Graham Family, who collectively own, on a
fully diluted basis, 65% of Grahams common shares, have also entered into
agreements to vote in favor of the transaction.

BofA Merrill Lynch acted as financial advisor to Silgan. Bryan Cave LLP served
as Silgans legal advisor.

Information provided and statements contained in this press release that are
not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Such forward-looking statements only speak as of the date of this press
release, and Silgan and Graham assume no obligation to update the information
included in this press release. Such forward-looking statements include
information concerning Silgans or Grahams possible or assumed future results
of operations. These statements often include words such as approximately,
believe, expect, anticipate, intend, plan, estimate or similar
expressions and may include, but are not limited to, statements about the
benefits of the proposed merger between Silgan and Graham, including future
financial and operating results, the combined companys plans, objectives,
expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical fact.
These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on
current expectations, estimates and projections about Silgans and Grahams
industry, managements beliefs and certain assumptions made by management,
many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Silgans
and Grahams control. Accordingly, readers are cautioned that any such
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are
subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to
predict, including, without limitation, the expected closing date of the
transaction; the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation
from the proposed merger will not be realized, or will not be realized within
the expected time period; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated
successfully; disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain
business and operational relationships; the risk that unexpected costs will be
incurred; changes in economic conditions, political conditions, trade
protection measures, licensing requirements and tax matters in the foreign
countries in which Silgan and Graham do business; the possibility that the
merger does not close, including, but not limited to, due to the failure to
satisfy the closing conditions; the risk that a regulatory approval may be
obtained subject to conditions; the risk that financing for the transaction
may not be available on favorable terms; and Silgans and Grahams ability to
accurately predict future market conditions. Additional factors that could
cause results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking
statements can be found in Silgans 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Grahams
2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K and each companys other filings with the SEC
available at the SECs website (http://www.sec.gov). Although Silgan and
Graham believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are reasonable as of the date made, expectations may prove to have
been materially different from the results expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. Unless otherwise required by law, Silgan and
Graham also disclaim any obligation to update their view of any such risks or
uncertainties or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to the
forward-looking statements made in this press release.

   The Leading Innovators in the Exchange Industry to Create the Worlds
Premier Exchange and Technology Company
Combination Recommended by both OMX and NASDAQ Boards and Supported by
                    Key OMX and NASDAQ Shareholders


STOCKHOLM, Sweden--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 25, 2007
The boards of directors of The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc.
(""NASDAQ"") and OMX AB (publ) (""OMX"") (STO:OMX) jointly announce that
they have entered into an agreement (the ""Transaction Agreement"") to
combine the two companies (the ""Combination"" or the ""Transaction""),
creating the world's premier exchange and technology company. The
Combination will create the largest global network of exchanges and
exchange customers linked by technology. The Combination will provide
significant benefits for customers, shareholders and other
stakeholders in both companies. The new group, to be called The NASDAQ
OMX Group (the ""Combined Group""), brings together two companies with a
common culture and vision of innovation, competitiveness and
pioneering technological expertise. NASDAQ OMX Group combines two
highly complementary businesses, uniting NASDAQ's leading global
brand, highly efficient electronic trading platform and track record
of customer focused innovation with OMX's global technology services
platform and customer base, efficient Nordic Exchange, derivatives
capabilities and track record of successful cross-border exchange
integrations.

   The Combination will be effected through a cash and stock tender
offer (the ""Offer"") by NASDAQ for all outstanding shares in OMX. The
consideration offered is equivalent to 0.502 new NASDAQ shares plus
SEK94.3 in cash for each OMX share. Based on NASDAQ's closing price on
23 May, 2007, the Offer values OMX at SEK208.1 per share , equivalent
to SEK25.1 billion ($3.7 billion) and represents a premium of 19
percent to the closing price of SEK174.5 per OMX share on 23 May,
2007, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the Offer
and a premium of 25 percent to the volume weighted average price of
SEK165.9 per OMX share over the 20 trading days up to and including 23
May, 2007.

   Robert Greifeld, Chief Executive Officer of NASDAQ, commented:

   ""The future of exchanges is about technology, flexibility and
scale. NASDAQ and OMX together deliver all of these benefits. Our
technology leadership and track record in linking trading platforms
means we will offer issuers and investors unique benefits which were
not available in one company until now. This combination provides our
organizations with the ability to grow and accelerate the global flow
of equity capital. At the same time, it provides us with an excellent
platform for further expansion into derivatives and other asset
classes. Our organizations bring together very complementary
businesses, and we see many new opportunities for growth in an era of
unprecedented change and development for exchanges.""

   Magnus Bocker, Chief Executive Officer of OMX, commented:

   ""This combination creates a new leader in the exchange industry.
By utilizing the combined entities' joint expertise and competencies
we will create an outstanding platform for future growth. Issuers,
members, information vendors and investors on both NASDAQ and OMX
Nordic Exchange will all benefit from its new global context. The
combination also provides benefits for OMX's global technology
customer base, as it enables an increased focus on research and
product development in the most important and fastest growing areas of
the exchange technology market.""

   H. Furlong Baldwin, Chairman of NASDAQ, commented:

   ""We are each coming at this combination from a position of
strength. At NASDAQ, we are privileged to be partnering with such a
reputable institution as the OMX.""

   Urban Backstrom, Chairman of OMX, commented:

   ""For OMX, as a company that has always been known for its
innovative and ground-breaking approach within the exchange industry,
this is the natural next step. This will also strengthen the Nordic
region as a financial center.""

   The Combined Group will have 2,349 employees in 22 countries with
pro forma revenues for the financial year 2006 of more than $1.2
billion (SEK8.3 billion). The relative values of the companies under
the terms of the Offer and based on NASDAQ's closing share price as of
23 May, 2007 are 58 percent NASDAQ and 42 percent OMX. The pro forma
market capitalization of The NASDAQ OMX Group will be approximately
$7.1 billion (SEK48.6 billion) , of which NASDAQ shareholders will own
approximately 72 percent and OMX shareholders will hold approximately
28 percent as a result of the cash component of the Offer. The
Combined Group will be governed by representatives from both NASDAQ
and OMX under the leadership of Robert Greifeld, who will serve as
Chief Executive Officer and Magnus Bocker, who will serve as
President. The board of directors of the Combined Group will consist
of 15 members, including nine representatives from NASDAQ, five
representatives from OMX and the Chief Executive Officer of the
Combined Group. The NASDAQ OMX share will be listed on NASDAQ and on
OMX Nordic Exchange.

   The Combination is unanimously recommended by the boards of
directors of each of OMX and NASDAQ. Investor AB, Nordea Bank AB and
Magnus Bocker, together representing approximately 16.6 percent of
OMX's current issued ordinary share capital, have entered into
irrevocable undertakings to accept the Offer and, if a mix and match
facility is included in the Offer, depending on the structure and the
terms of the facility, they will elect to receive all shares, subject
to proration. Olof Stenhammar & Company, representing approximately
1.6 percent of OMX's current issued ordinary share capital, has
expressed its support for the Combination and its intention to become
a long term shareholder in the Combined Group. In addition, Hellman &
Friedman, Silver Lake Partners, and Robert Greifeld have each agreed
to vote their shares in favor of certain matters related to the Offer
at the related NASDAQ shareholders' meeting, subject to the terms of
NASDAQ's certificate of incorporation.

   The Combination will create:

   -- PREMIER GLOBAL EXCHANGE COMPANY: NASDAQ is the premier US
equities exchange, handling more shares and listing more companies
than any other US exchange. NASDAQ's open and innovative market
platform is the first choice for issuers as well as investors. OMX
Nordic Exchange is a highly integrated, efficient equities and
derivatives market for leading European companies. Together, the
NASDAQ and OMX exchanges will process an average daily volume of 7.4
million trades, representing a value of approximately $61 billion
(SEK418 billion). The NASDAQ and OMX exchanges will have approximately
4,000 companies listed from 39 countries with an aggregate market
capitalization of approximately $5.5 trillion (SEK37.6 trillion);

   -- WORLD EXCHANGE TECHNOLOGY LEADER: OMX has been a pioneer in
creating a truly integrated cross-border stock market. OMX also has
created a world-renowned technology customer base of equity, debt, and
derivatives exchanges with 60 clients in 50 countries worldwide,
including Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, and the US. NASDAQ
pioneered electronic trading, and has continued to innovate over the
last thirty years and now has the fastest, most efficient trading
platform in the US. Together, the Combined Group will provide the
technology for the world's increasingly competitive and demanding
capital markets;

   -- INCREASED VISIBILITY AND ACCESS TO THE GLOBAL INVESTMENT
MARKETPLACE FOR ISSUERS: Issuers will be associated with an
innovative, future-focused company with blue-chip peers in all
industry sectors. Listed companies will have access to a broad base of
investors and deep pools of liquidity;

   -- A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE DERIVATIVES MARKET OFFERING: OMX Nordic
Exchange is Europe's third largest marketplace for trading and
clearing equity-related derivatives. OMX's Nordic distribution network
is extended through an international network of links to cooperating
exchanges and clearinghouses. OMX's technology solutions are also
being used by other leading derivatives exchanges around the world and
will be a key asset in the Combined Group's opportunities to capture
the high growth in derivatives trading globally;

   -- ENHANCED STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES: The Combined Group will be
the partner of choice for future cooperation and consolidation
opportunities and have increased financial and managerial resources.
The combined entity will be well positioned to drive organic growth
and to continue to take a proactive role in sector consolidation, in
Europe, emerging markets, the Americas and Asia; and

   -- SIGNIFICANT SYNERGY POTENTIAL: Both parties believe the
Combination will create substantial value for shareholders, with total
pre-tax annual synergies estimated at $150 million (SEK1,025 million).
Of this amount, $100 million (SEK683 million) constitutes estimated
cost synergies and $50 million (SEK342 million) estimated revenue
synergies. Cost synergies will be realized through the rationalization
of IT systems and data centres, rationalization of non-IT functions,
and reduced capital and procurement expenditure. Revenue synergies
will be achieved through the creation of deeper liquidity pools,
increased cross-border trading, increased international listings,
packaged data products and enhanced technology sales.

   The Combination is expected to create substantial value for
shareholders and to be accretive to earnings per share in 2009.

   This summary should be read in conjunction with the text of the
attached full announcement.

Combination of NASDAQ and OMX will be held today at 10.00am CET at OMX

  PR Newswire

  ST. LOUIS, March 30

ST. LOUIS, March 30 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) today
confirmed that it has submitted a non-binding indicative proposal to Macarthur
Coal Limited (ASX: MCC).

Macarthur is a leading Australian-based producer of low-volatile PCl
metallurgical coal.  The company controls 145 million tons of reserves and 1.3
billion tons of resources.  It has current production capacity of more than 5
million tons per year, with growth potential from mines in development.

Under Peabody's proposal, Macarthur shareholders would receive a cash price of
A$13 per share, representing a total equity value of A$3.3 billion (US$3.0
billion).

This price represents a 34 percent premium to the price of Macarthur shares to
be issued to Noble Group as part of the previously announced transactions with
Gloucester and Noble, and is above the top end of the recent Independent
Expert's valuation, which included significant value attributable to
Macarthur's growth assets.

Under Peabody's proposal Macarthur's three largest shareholders would be
offered the alternative of retaining their existing interest in Macarthur.
 The proposal contemplates a scheme of arrangement being put by Macarthur to
its shareholders for approval, which would result in Macarthur being
privatized and operated and controlled by Peabody.  

Peabody's proposal is conditional upon Macarthur's current offer to acquire
Gloucester Coal and the associated Noble transactions not proceeding, and any
transaction will be subject to regulatory approvals and other customary
conditions.

Peabody believes that there is a strong strategic rationale for a combination
of Macarthur's operating assets and project pipeline with Peabody's growing
Australian platform of metallurgical and thermal coal production.

Peabody believes that its proposal can deliver a superior outcome for all
Macarthur shareholders and is disappointed with the Macarthur board's initial
reaction. Peabody remains open to engaging with the Macarthur board to
progress its proposal. Peabody has initiated discussions with Macarthur's
three largest shareholders and those discussions are continuing.

Background

On 22 December, 2009 Macarthur announced an offer to acquire all of the issued
shares of Gloucester Coal Limited, an ASX listed company.  

Noble is the largest shareholder of Gloucester, holding 87.7% of Gloucester
shares.  Noble has stated that if it accepts the Gloucester offer, it will
receive Macarthur shares and not cash.  On 29 January, 2010, Macarthur also
announced that it has entered into other conditional agreements with Noble.
 Under all of these transactions, Noble would acquire up to 24.6 percent of
Macarthur and become its largest shareholder.  

A meeting of Macarthur shareholders has been convened for 12 April, 2010 for
Macarthur shareholders to consider the issue of Macarthur shares to Noble.  

Macarthur commissioned an Independent Expert's Report to opine on the proposed
issue of Macarthur shares to Noble.  The Independent Expert's Report dated 26
February 2010 stated that the issue of Macarthur shares to Noble is not fair,
but is reasonable, and concluded a value range for 100 percent of Macarthur
from A$9.84 to A$12.49 per share.

Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) is the world's largest private-sector coal company,
with 2009 sales of 244 million tons and $6 billion in revenues. Its coal
products fuel 10 percent of all U.S. electricity generation and 2 percent of
worldwide electricity.

Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking as defined in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking
statements are based on numerous assumptions that the company believes are
reasonable, but they are open to a wide range of uncertainties and business
risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.
These factors are difficult to accurately predict and may be beyond the
company's control. The company does not undertake to update its
forward-looking statements. Factors that could affect results include those
described in this press release as well as risks detailed in the company's
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Business Wire

NEW YORK & ZUG, Switzerland -- June 12, 2011

Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: TRH) and Allied World Assurance Company
Holdings, AG (NYSE: AWH) today announced the signing of a definitive merger
agreement that will create a leading, global specialty insurance and
reinsurance company. The combined entity will have total invested assets of
$21 billion, total shareholders equity of nearly $7 billion, and total
capital of $8.5 billion. The combined company will operate under a holding
company structure with the corporate name TransAllied Group Holdings, AG,
offering specialty insurance and reinsurance products and services via two
distinct brands  Transatlantic Reinsurance and Allied World Insurance.

The transaction is structured as a merger of equals, with shareholders of
Transatlantic receiving 0.88 Allied World common shares for each Transatlantic
common share held. Following the merger, Transatlantic shareholders will own
approximately 58% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, with
Allied World shareholders owning approximately 42%.

Upon completion of the merger, Scott Carmilani, Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, AG, will serve
as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the new company, with overall
responsibility for the global organization. Mike Sapnar, Executive Vice
President and Chief Operating Officer of Transatlantic, will serve as
President and Chief Executive Officer, Global Reinsurance. Both Carmilani and
Sapnar will serve on the combined companys Board of Directors, which will
have 11 seats, six appointed by Transatlantic and five by Allied World.
Richard Press, Transatlantics non-executive Chairman, will serve as the
non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors for the combined company for
the first year following the closing of the merger to provide stewardship
during the integration process.

Robert Orlich, President and Chief Executive Officer of Transatlantic, who
will retire upon the closing of the transaction, stated, Transatlantic and
Allied World make great merger partners in every sense of the term. For
Transatlantic in particular, the transaction delivers strategic and financial
benefits, including primary insurance operations, a Lloyds presence and a
bigger capital base outside the U.S., allowing for greater capital allocation
flexibility. I look forward to helping see this transaction through to
completion, after which Scott and Mike are the right team to move this forward
and capitalize on the great opportunity for the new company to create value
for shareholders.

Scott Carmilani commented, ""We are very excited about this strategic
combination of two industry leading insurance and reinsurance franchises. The
combined company will enjoy significant scale with $8.5 billion in capital and
$21 billion in invested assets. More importantly, both companies operations
will benefit from a significant global footprint with access to distribution
channels within all major markets as well as attractive geographic and product
diversity. Collectively, we will have 39 offices located throughout 18
countries worldwide.

I have long admired Bob Orlich, Mike Sapnar and the management team at
Transatlantic and the specialty reinsurance business they have built, which
very much complements Allied Worlds specialty insurance focus. This merger
will only serve to strengthen the combined companys market profile and
competitive position, greatly enhancing our capabilities to post strong
returns through all phases of the industry cycle. Both management teams have a
strong track record of building value for their shareholders over the long
run, and we are eager to continue doing just that as part of one
organization.

As a result of the merger, the combined company, its shareholders, clients,
trading partners and employees, should benefit from:

  * Increased financial strength, a stronger capital base and greater business
    diversification
  * Access to additional growth opportunities with greater diversity, enhanced
    structural flexibility, and improved earnings stability
  * A full suite of products and services
  * Expanded distribution and a global platform

Both companies boards of directors have unanimously approved the transaction.
Closing is estimated for the fourth quarter of 2011, subject to approval by
the shareholders of the respective companies, receipt of regulatory approvals
and notices, and other customary closing conditions.

    deal not close for any reasons that are under your control by December 31,
    2011, a break-up fee of $75.0 million would be paid to us.
  * Your commitment that until the deal closes, you will continue to manage
    the affairs of the company in a manner that is consistent with how you
    have managed it historically.

I have deliberately tried to be brief and to the point. I will be happy to

        Containers, Widely Regarded as the Technology and Innovation
        Leader in its Industry

   --  Blackstone Group to Maintain Largest Ownership Stake for Two
        Years

   --  Transaction Will Preserve Company's Existing Capital Structure


DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 30, 2008
Hicks Acquisition Company I, Inc. (AMEX: TOH) (""Hicks
Acquisition""), a Dallas-based special purpose acquisition company
(""SPAC"") founded and headed by Thomas O. Hicks, announced today that
it has reached an agreement in principle - subject to execution of a
definitive agreement, which is expected to be finalized in the next
few days - pursuant to which Graham Packaging Holdings Co. (""Graham
Packaging"" or the ""Company"") will go public through a transaction with
Hicks Acquisition in partnership with The Blackstone Group and the
Graham Group (together, the ""Current Graham Equity Holders""). The
transaction, valued at approximately $3.2 billion, is believed to be
the largest ever between a SPAC and an industrial company.

   Following completion of the transaction, the combined enterprise
will be renamed Graham Packaging Company and will apply for listing on
the New York Stock Exchange. Blackstone has agreed it will maintain
the largest ownership stake for at least two years as it continues to
play an important role in guiding the Company strategically and
operationally.

   Founded in 1972 and based in York, Pennsylvania, Graham Packaging,
with 2007 net sales of approximately $2.5 billion, is a global
technology and innovation leader in value-added blow-molded rigid
plastic containers for the branded food and beverage, household,
personal care/specialty and automotive lubricant industries.
Approximately 90 percent of the Company's sales are in product
categories in which it holds the number-one market position.
Reflecting the importance to its customers of high levels of
manufacturing expertise and technological innovation, the Company
estimates that 80 percent of its products make use of proprietary
Graham Packaging technology.

   Mr. Hicks, founder and Chairman of Hicks Acquisition, said: ""After
considering more than a hundred possible transactions, we're
tremendously pleased to have identified Graham Packaging as the right
transaction for Hicks Acquisition, and to be partnering with
Blackstone, whose senior partners I have had close business
relationships with for many years, and the other Current Graham Equity
Holders. Under the leadership since December 2006 of a new management
team headed by Chairman and CEO Warren Knowlton and COO/CFO Mark
Burgess, Graham Packaging has burnished its already-outstanding
reputation as the technology and innovation leader in its industry's
high-value-added segment and has significantly improved its
operational and financial performance. We look forward to completing
the transaction and supporting the management team as they continue to
create value for Graham Packaging's customers, continue to build a
solid platform for profitable growth, and work to realize Graham
Packaging's full operational, financial and investment potential.""

   Chinh Chu, a Graham Packaging board member and a Senior Managing
Director at Blackstone, said: ""Blackstone is pleased to partner with
Tom Hicks and management for this next chapter of Graham Packaging as
a public company.""

   Warren Knowlton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Graham
Packaging, said: ""We look forward to partnering with Tom Hicks and
Blackstone, both of whom have long track records of value creation.
Graham Packaging has made significant progress since December 2006.
With the support of our new ownership group and our strong free cash
flow from operations, we will continue to invest in and grow our
business, pay down debt, accelerate our earnings growth, and meet the
needs and expectations of our employees, customers, suppliers and
stockholders.""

   Graham Packaging is a market leader in value-added custom plastic
containers, producing more than 20 billion container units annually at
83 manufacturing plants in North America, Europe and South America. It
is the leading supplier of plastic containers for hot-fill juice and
juice drinks, sports drinks, drinkable yogurt and smoothies,
nutritional supplements, wide-mouth food, condiments, beer, liquid
laundry detergent and motor oil.

   The Company provides custom valued-added products to many of the
world's leading consumer product companies, including, among others,
PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Danone/Dannon, Ocean Spray, Heinz, Abbott, Arizona
Beverages, Nestle/Gerber, Anheuser-Busch, SAB Miller, Procter &
Gamble, Unilever, Church & Dwight, Dial/Henkel, Clorox and Colgate.

   The Company has an extensive global footprint and has led the
industry in situating its manufacturing operations on or near the
customer's premises. A third of the Company's plants employ an on-site
manufacturing strategy. ""We believe our collocation strategy enhances
coordination with our customer base and is the cornerstone of improved
sustainability for our customers and for us,"" said Mr. Knowlton.

   Details of the Transaction

   Graham Packaging will go public through the transaction with Hicks
Acquisition. In connection with the transaction, the current
stockholders of Graham Packaging will receive $350 million of cash
held in trust, 35.0 million common shares, and 2.8 million warrants
upon completion of the transaction. The purchase consideration
includes a transfer of value to the Current Graham Equity Holders of
approximately 2.8 million Founder's shares and warrants. In exchange,
the Hicks-led sponsor will retain, through a series of transactions,
Earnout Units, the shares of which have a trigger price of $13.75 and
the warrants of which will become exercisable at a strike price of
$10.00 and a trigger price of $15.00.

   The transaction has been structured to preserve Graham Packaging's
existing capital structure and does not breach, or result in a default
under, the Company's existing credit facilities or constitute a
""change of control"" under the indentures of the Company's existing
senior and senior subordinated notes issues.

   Hicks Acquisition's existing public stockholders along with Mr.
Hicks will own approximately 66 percent of Graham's common shares
outstanding after the completion of the transaction. The Current
Graham Equity Holders, led by Blackstone, will remain in the aggregate
the Company's largest shareholder, with approximately 34 percent of
the common shares outstanding, and will continue to play an important
role in guiding the Company. The aforementioned common stock ownership
percentages are calculated as basic ownership and exclude warrants and
options from the ownership calculation. The existing management team,
including Chairman and CEO Warren Knowlton and COO/CFO Mark Burgess,
will continue to lead the Company. Completion of the transaction is
subject to expiration or early termination of the applicable
Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, Hicks Acquisition stockholder
approval and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to
occur later this year.

   Hicks Acquisition was advised with regard to the transaction by
Citi and the law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. Houlihan
Lokey served as a financial advisor to the independent directors of
Hicks Acquisition. Graham Packaging was advised with regard to the
transaction by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Blackstone Advisory
Partners, and the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLC.

   Necessary Steps for Consummation of the Transaction

   As provided in Hicks Acquisition's certificate of incorporation,
each holder of Hicks Acquisition's common stock has the right to
convert such holder's shares into cash if such holder votes against
the transaction, elects to exercise such holder's conversion rights
and the transaction is approved and completed.

   Hicks Acquisition cannot complete the transaction unless (1) a
majority of the shares issued in the initial public offering cast at
the stockholders' meeting are voted in favor of the transaction; (2)
holders of no more than 16,559,999 shares of common stock (such number
representing 30 percent minus one share of the 55,200,000 shares of
Hicks Acquisition issued in the initial public offering) vote against
the transaction and exercise their conversion rights to have their
shares converted into cash; and (3) certain other customary conditions
are satisfied.

   All of Hicks Acquisition's initial stockholders have agreed to
vote an aggregate of 13,800,000 shares, or 20.0% of Hicks
Acquisition's outstanding common stock, issued to them prior to the
initial public offering in accordance with the vote of the holders of
a majority of the shares issued in the initial public offering and
have agreed to vote any of shares acquired in or following the initial
public offering in favor of the transaction.

DEERFIELD, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 12, 2008
Walgreens (NYSE: WAG) (NASDAQ: WAG):

   --  Approximate $3 Billion Proposal is Superior to Pending
        CVS/Caremark Agreement

   --  Acquisition Strengthens Walgreens Presence in Attractive
        Growth Markets

   --  Company Working with Lubert-Adler Management Company, LP and
        Klaff Realty, LP to Address any Potential Store Sales in
        Connection with Transaction

   Walgreens (NYSE: WAG) (NASDAQ: WAG) today proposed to acquire all
of the outstanding shares of Longs Drug Stores Corporation (NYSE: LDG)
for $75 per share in cash for a total purchase price of approximately
$3 billion including the assumption of debt. The offer, which is
subject to standard regulatory approvals and the completion of due
diligence, represents a $3.50 per share premium over the cash purchase
price to be paid to Longs shareholders under the proposed acquisition
by CVS/Caremark Corporation (NYSE: CVS) announced on Aug. 12.

   As a result of this transaction, Walgreens would acquire Longs'
retail drugstores in California, Hawaii, Nevada and Arizona, as well
as its RxAmerica, LLC subsidiary, which offers prescription benefits
management (PBM) services.

   The combination would provide substantial strategic and financial
benefits, including strengthening Walgreens ability to serve customers
in fast growing markets and broaden its presence in the highly
attractive Hawaii market.

   ""We believe the combination of Walgreens and Longs is a highly
compelling transaction that is superior to the pending transaction
with CVS/Caremark, accelerates Walgreens expansion into high growth
markets and delivers meaningful cost synergies,"" said Walgreens
Chairman and CEO Jeffrey A. Rein.

   ""We've completed six significant acquisitions in just over two
years and have a proven track record of integrating companies to
benefit our customers and employees. We look forward to Longs' careful
consideration of our offer and an open dialogue with its board of
directors to complete this transaction.""

   Walgreens is working with Lubert-Adler Management Company, LP and
Klaff Realty, LP to address any potential store sales in connection
with the transaction.

   Goldman, Sachs & Co. is serving as financial advisor to Walgreens
on this transaction, and Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP is serving as
its legal advisor.

     Board of Directors
     Longs Drug Stores Corporation
     c/o Warren Bryant
     Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
     141 North Civic Drive
     Walnut Creek, CA 94596

     Dear Members of the Board of Directors:

         On behalf of Walgreen Co. (""Walgreens""), we are pleased to
          submit a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding common
          stock of Longs Drug Stores Corporation (""Longs""). We have
          carefully studied the proposed merger between Longs and CVS
          Caremark Corporation (""CVS"") and believe that our proposal
          is superior to the pending transaction with CVS.

         We propose to acquire all of Longs outstanding shares of
          common stock at a price of $75.00 per share in cash. This
          price represents a $3.50 per share premium to the purchase
          price to be paid to your stockholders pursuant to the
          announced merger between Longs and CVS (the ""CVS
          Transaction"") and a premium of approximately 39% to Longs
          closing stock price on August 12, 2008, the last trading day
          prior to the announcement of the CVS transaction. We are
          prepared to agree to terms and conditions that are at least
          as favorable to Longs stockholders as those in the Agreement
          and Plan of Merger, dated August 12, 2008 (the ""Merger
          Agreement""), with CVS. In addition to our offer price of
          $75.00 per share, we are prepared to pay the $115 million
          Termination Fee set forth in the Merger Agreement, if
          applicable.

         We are confident that we will obtain all government approvals
          necessary for the transaction, including antitrust approval.
          In order to address any concerns, however, we would be
          willing to modify Section 9.02 of the Merger Agreement to
          provide an affirmative obligation for Walgreens to take
          those steps required to be taken to secure the necessary
          regulatory approvals to the extent that such steps involved
          assets of Longs representing no more than 40% of Longs'
          consolidated operating profit for the twelve-month period
          ending January 31, 2008. In addition, we have been working
          with real estate investors, Lubert-Adler Management Company,
          L.P. and Klaff Realty, LP, to address any potential store
          sales that may be necessary in connection with the potential
          transaction.

         As you are aware, Walgreens has had long-standing, sincere
          interest in Longs. Walgreens has great respect for your
          company and its employees and believes there is significant
          strategic merit to a transaction. In our prior discussions,
          we expressed a willingness to offer up to $70.00 per share
          in cash for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
          Longs, which was subject to our receipt of customary due
          diligence materials. As you know, we were never provided
          with the due diligence materials.

         Our proposal is subject to completion of due diligence by
          Walgreens and the real estate investors, satisfaction of
          customary closing conditions (which already are set forth in
          the Merger Agreement) and termination of the Merger
          Agreement in accordance with its terms. We will be able to
          complete our diligence review promptly so that upon
          termination of your Merger Agreement, we can quickly execute
          a new merger agreement. Furthermore, we have secured all
          internal approvals necessary for this proposal, including
          Board approval, and will have the necessary financing to
          consummate the proposed transaction without a financing
          contingency.

         We are confident that after you have considered our proposal
          you will agree that its terms are substantially more
          attractive to your stockholders than the CVS transaction. We
          believe that our proposal is a ""Superior Proposal,"" as
          defined in the Merger Agreement, and at a minimum, our
          proposal represents a ""bona fide Acquisition Proposal"" that
          ""will lead to a Superior Proposal"" under the terms of the
          Merger Agreement. Given that, we expect that you will
          provide us with access to due diligence materials and meet
          with us regarding our proposal as soon as possible.

         It was necessary to communicate our proposal to you by letter
          because of the provisions of the Merger Agreement. Given the
          importance of our proposal to our respective stockholders,
          we have determined to make this letter public. We would
          unquestionably prefer to work directly with you to complete
          a negotiated transaction that would produce substantial
          benefits for our respective stockholders. We are prepared,
          however, to take our transaction directly to your
          stockholders.

         This letter constitutes a bona-fide, non-binding expression
          of interest on the part of Walgreens. This letter does not
          create or constitute any legally binding obligation,
          liability or commitment by Walgreens or any of our
          affiliates regarding the proposed transaction, and, other
          than any confidentiality agreement we may enter into with
          you, there will be no legally binding agreement between us
          regarding the proposed transaction unless and until a
          definitive merger agreement is executed by Longs and
          Walgreens.

         We have engaged Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Weil, Gotshal &
          Manges LLP to advise us in this transaction. We are ready to
          begin our due diligence immediately and are prepared to move
          forward expeditiously and devote our full efforts and
          resources to promptly complete a transaction.

         Our proposal presents a compelling opportunity for Longs
          stockholders, and we look forward to hearing from you as
          soon as possible.

            Sincerely,

            /s/Jeffrey A. Rein

By Elisabeth Behrmann
     Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the
worlds biggest corn processor, offered A$2.7 billion ($2.8
billion) cash for GrainCorp Ltd. to gain agricultural storage
and handling assets in Australia.
     ADM made a non-binding takeover bid at A$11.75 a share,
Sydney-based GrainCorp said today in statement, 33 percent more
than its last traded price. Decatur, Illinois-based ADM last
week paid A$269 million for a 10 percent stake in eastern
Australias largest grain handler to increase its holding to
14.9 percent.
     The GrainCorp board is reviewing the proposal and has not
yet formed a view on its merits and will keep the market
informed of any material developments, the company said in the
statement.
     Buying GrainCorp would help ADM boost sales in Asia, the
second-biggest region for GrainCorps products and services.
Last year, revenue from Asia more than doubled compared with the
previous 12 months. ADM last year earned 52 percent of its
revenue in the U.S., data compiled by Bloomberg shows.
     Credit Suisse Group AG and Greenhill & Co Inc. are advising
GrainCorp while Citigroup Inc. is acting for ADM.
     GrainCorp fell 2.1 percent in Sydney on Oct. 18 to A$8.85.
Its shares have gained 14 percent this year.

GARMIN LTD (""GRMN-Q"")
- Intends to Make a Cash Offer for Tele Atlas N.V.

     Garmin Ltd. announced that it notified the supervisory and managing
boards (collectively the ""Boards"") of Tele Atlas N.V. (""Tele Atlas"" or ""the
Company"") to-day of its intention to make a public offer for all the
outstanding shares of Tele Atlas N.V. on a fully diluted basis at an
indicative offer price of euro 24.50 in cash per share (the ""Offer""),
implying an equity value for the Company of euro 2.3 billion. The intended
Offer will be subject to customary conditions, such as receipt of the
requisite antitrust approvals and tender of at least 66.67% of the issued
share capital. In addition to its cash balance in excess of $1 billion,
Garmin has secured financing commitments sufficient for the intended Offer.
Garmin plans to launch the offer before December 4, 2007 (the scheduled
expiry date of TomTom's offer).

    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20061026/CGTH082LOGO)

    Garmin believes that a combination of Garmin and Tele Atlas provides
the best value for all stakeholders for the following reasons:

//st
    -- Garmin's intended offer is a materially higher cash value for
       Tele Atlas' shareholders than the offer made by TomTom, 15%
       higher than the offer by TomTom and a 48% premium to the
       undisturbed Tele Atlas share price on July 20, 2007
    -- A combined company will allow Tele Atlas' employees and customers
       to leverage Garmin's large worldwide user base and industry
       leading technology to further contribute to the creation of
       superior mapping coverage, quality and shared content for all of
       Tele Atlas' current and future customers
    -- Garmin's broad international footprint, global market share and
       strong balance sheet will promote the growth ambitions and
       prospects of Tele Atlas and its employees
    -- In addition to the benefits associated with the portable
       navigation market, a combined company will expand Garmin's
       ability to serve more customers in wireless, in-dash automotive,
       internet, and enterprise markets by offering a broad range of
       solutions including content, applications, and devices.
//et

    Commenting on the announcement, Garmin CEO Dr. Min Kao said: ""Given the
high growth and rapid change the navigation market has undergone to date,
we feel that now is the right time for Garmin to move ahead with this
proposed combination with Tele Atlas. Together, we believe that we can
create the best available mapping solutions for our customers around the
world. We also intend to make Tele Atlas' content available to the entire
navigation market on a non-discriminatory basis, promoting healthy
competition, with significant benefits to the navigation market and all its
consumers.""
    It is Garmin's intention that Tele Atlas, following the completion of
the strategic combination with Garmin, will continue its business as a
separate entity, based and headquartered in the Netherlands. Garmin wishes
to retain the existing management team and all of the Tele Atlas employees
and would welcome them into its global family of nearly 8,000 employees. It
also strongly believes that the increased scale of operations of the
proposed combination will offer exciting and enhanced career opportunities
to Tele Atlas' employees and will create additional jobs in the
Netherlands.
    Calls were placed earlier to-day by Garmin executives to Tele Atlas
executives. Prior to this there has been no contact between the two
companies or their respective advisers concerning a strategic combination.
In accordance with section 9d(2) of the Dutch Securities Market Supervision
Decree 1995 (Besluit toezicht effectenverkeer 1995, the ""Decree""), Garmin
has invited the Boards to meet with Garmin management within 7 days to
discuss the intended Offer and to determine whether the intended Offer
could receive the support and recommendation of each of the Boards. Garmin
prefers that the intended Offer be supported by each of the Boards but such
support and recommendation is not a condition to launching and consummating
the Offer.
    Garmin is a leading, worldwide provider of navigation, communications
and information devices with subsidiaries in the United States, Canada,
Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Brazil and Singapore with
pending acquisitions in Denmark, Italy and Spain. Through its operating
subsidiaries the company designs, develops, manufactures and markets a
diverse family of hand-held, portable and fixed-mount GPS-enabled products
and other navigation, communications and information products. Garmin's
projected FY 2007 revenues are nearly US$3 billion, and the company expects
to ship more than 10 million devices in 2007. Garmin sells its products
through a worldwide network of approximately 3,000 independent dealers and
distributors in approximately 100 countries.
    This is an announcement in accordance with section 9b(2)(b) and section
9d(2) of the Decree.
    Garmin's key advisers are Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Wachovia
Capital Markets LLC, Allen & Overy, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP,
Ernst & Young, KPMG and Finsbury.
    Garmin executives will discuss this transaction to-day at 10.00
CST/11.00 EST/15.00 GMT/16.00 CET during its third quarter earnings call.

CARL C. ICAHN ISSUES OPEN LETTER TO BOARD OF DIRECTORS
OF COMMERCIAL METALS COMPANY

New York, New York, November 28, 2011
Contact: Susan Gordon (212) 702-4309

Carl C. Icahn, Chairman of the Board of the general partner of
Icahn Enterprises LP (NYSE:  IEP), issued the following open
letter today to the Board of Directors of Commercial Metals
Company.  Pursuant to Mr. Icahns letter, Icahn Enterprises
offered to acquire Commercial Metals Company at $15 per share
without any financing or due diligence conditions.

The letter is as follows:

Carl C. Icahn

November 28, 2011

Board of Directors
Commercial Metals Company
6565 North MacArthur Boulevard, Suite 800
Irving, Texas 75039

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am currently your largest shareholder and beneficially own
9.98% of the outstanding common shares of Commercial Metals
Company (the Company) through several affiliated entities,
including subsidiaries of Icahn Enterprises LP (NYSE: IEP).
Based upon publicly available information, Icahn Enterprises
(which currently has, on a consolidated basis, $22.4 billion of
assets, including in excess of $13 billion in liquid assets,
which are cash and marketable securities) hereby proposes to
purchase the Company in a merger transaction at $15 per share
without any financing or due diligence conditions.  That price
represents a premium of 31% over the stocks closing price on
November 25, 2011, which was $11.45, and a premium of 72.6% from
its low this year on October 3, 2011, which was $8.60.

IEP is prepared to proceed to immediately negotiate and execute
definitive documents.  We firmly believe that the Boards
fiduciary duties require the Board to allow shareholders to
decide for themselves if they wish to accept this offer.
Accordingly, we are also prepared to structure the transaction
with an immediate front end tender offer, with protections for
minority shareholders pending completion of the merger.
This transaction will allow shareholders the opportunity to
monetize their investment in the Company. Those who desire to
stay invested in this industry could take their proceeds and
invest in direct competitors in the steel industry which we
believe are much better managed and better situated to take
advantage of any possible economic recovery than Commercial
Metals.

The reason IEP is paying a 31% premium over the November 25,
2011 closing price is because of IEPs ownership of PSC Metals
Inc.  When the acquisition is completed IEP intends to combine
Commercial Metals with IEPs own metals recycling assets.  IEP
will sell Commercial Metals non-core assets and immediately
appoint a new management team to run the steel business.  In our
opinion, these undertakings are imperative to realize future
profits at Commercial Metals.

As a 10% shareholder of Commercial Metals we are extremely
concerned about the capabilities and behavior of the current
Board and management, and therefore, we intend to nominate three
individuals as directors at the Companys 2012 annual meeting of
shareholders, as well as make several proposals for shareholder
consideration.  We do not believe the current Board is capable
or willing to undertake the actions necessary to enable
Commercial Metals to compete in the future.  Such actions
include, but are not limited to, the sale of non-core assets,
the immediate replacement of management, and the refocusing of
the business on core operations in North America.  The track
record established by the current Board and management team over
the last several years is dismal. Unfortunately, a below average
operating performance fueled by a distracting and misguided
international growth plan, combined with a disastrous investment
record, has become the defining characteristic of Commercial
Metals.  We have no confidence in managements ability to
continue running the Company, nor do we have any confidence that
the Board will ever hold management accountable for poor
performance - as shown by the recent and inexplicable bonuses
paid to management.  But, hopefully, even this Board will
finally take its fiduciary duty to shareholders seriously enough
to allow shareholders to decide whether or not to sell the
Company at a 31% premium over current market price.

Your management team has suggested a recovery in key end markets
will not materialize in 2012.  Further, in our opinion, because
the Company has been so poorly managed, shareholders are exposed
not only to cyclical industry risks, but also to permanent
risks.  Astoundingly, between 2006 and 2011, the Company
squandered $2 billion of capital on ill-conceived acquisitions
and growth projects, many of which generated negative EBITDA
through the period.

Despite this dismal record, the Board recently granted bonuses
to management, including a $750,000 bonus to the new CEO -- for
what exactly?!  Not in recognition of the Companys operating
performance, but because management threw in the towel and
admitted that the Company should walk away from many of the
substantial investments that you approved only a few years
earlier.  The logic is absurd!  The Company spends shareholder
money on disastrous investments, and then several years later,
awards management special bonuses - again shareholder money -
for having the courage to run away from those very same
investments!

Unfortunately, over the next several years even if the steel
markets shift into a cyclical recovery, we fear, and believe,
that Commercial Metals will simply shift back from the current
strategy where management is supposedly focused on unwinding its
disastrous investments, to the previous strategy, where
management travels the world investing in losing growth
projects from Croatia to Australia.
In light of the above, we again ask you to finally show that
even this Board is serious enough about its fiduciary
obligations to allow shareholders, and not themselves, to decide
whether to sell the Company at a substantial premium over the
current market price.  We would like to move forward immediately
and we are ready to meet.  We are prepared to enter immediate
negotiations and would like to see a tender offer launched as
soon as possible.

Carl C. Icahn

HLTH CORPORATION AND WEBMD ANNOUNCE AGREEMENT TO MERGE 
ELMWOOD PARK, NJ and NEW YORK, NY (February 21, 2008)  HLTH Corporation (Nasdaq: HLTH) and its 84% owned subsidiary, WebMD Health Corp. (Nasdaq: WBMD), announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which HLTH will merge into WebMD. In the merger, each outstanding share of HLTH common stock will be converted into 0.1979 shares of WebMD common stock and $6.89 in cash, subject to adjustment as described below. The shares of WebMD Class A Common Stock currently outstanding will remain outstanding and will be unchanged in the merger. The merger will eliminate both the controlling class of WebMD stock held by HLTH and WebMDs existing dual-class stock structure. 
In commenting on the merger, Martin J Wygod, Chairman and Acting CEO of HLTH and Chairman of WebMD said, This merger will achieve the objectives set forth by both companies at the beginning of this process. The merger is expected to reduce WebMDs share count by 20%, to eliminate HLTHs controlling interest in WebMD and to capitalize WebMD with approximately $700 million in cash and investments. As a result, WebMD will be well positioned to pursue future opportunities. Based on yesterdays closing prices, HLTH shareholders will receive a 26% premium for their shares and direct ownership in WebMD. Upon completion of the merger, HLTH shareholders will own approximately 80% of WebMD, based on the shares currently outstanding at HLTH and WebMD. 
The cash portion of the merger consideration will be funded from cash and investments at WebMD and HLTH, and proceeds from HLTHs anticipated sales of its ViPS and Porex businesses. As previously announced, HLTH has received significant interest from potential strategic buyers for both ViPS and Porex and will be moving rapidly to obtain formal offers for these businesses from potential buyers. HLTH announced today that it intends to divest these businesses. These divestitures are not dependent on the merger and do not require shareholder approval. After the close of the merger and the divestitures of ViPS and Porex, it is expected that WebMD will continue to benefit from significant remaining Federal net operating loss carryforwards. The cash portion of the merger consideration is subject to downward adjustment prior to closing, based on the amount of proceeds received from the disposition of HLTHs investment in certain auction rate securities (ARS), which, under the terms of the merger agreement, must be liquidated by HLTH prior to closing of the merger. As described in a separate press release issued by HLTH today, HLTH has approximately $195 million of investments in certain ARS, excluding any ARS investments held by WebMD. The types of ARS investments that HLTH owns are backed by student loans, 97% of which are guaranteed under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). 
  



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 

If either ViPS or Porex has not been sold at the time the HLTH-WebMD merger is ready to be consummated, WebMD may issue up to $250 million in redeemable notes to the HLTH shareholders in lieu of a portion of the cash consideration otherwise payable in the merger. The notes would bear interest at a rate of 11% per annum, payable in kind annually in arrears. The notes would be subject to mandatory redemption by WebMD from the proceeds of the divestiture of the remaining ViPS or Porex business. The redemption price would be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest through the date of the redemption. 
Based on the shares currently outstanding at both HLTH and WebMD, there will be approximately 45 million shares of WebMD common stock outstanding following the closing of the merger, which will represent a reduction of approximately 20% from the 57 million WebMD shares currently outstanding today. Additionally, it is estimated that WebMD will have approximately $700 million in available cash and investments after receiving the anticipated proceeds from sales of the Porex and ViPS businesses and the payment of the cash consideration in the merger. The number of shares outstanding following the merger and the amount of cash remaining after payment of the cash consideration both reflect the assumption that the existing HLTH convertible notes remain outstanding after the merger. 
The senior management team of WebMD will continue to lead the organization under Wayne Gattinella, President and CEO. WebMD currently operates as a separate public company and, after a transition period, does not expect to incur significant incremental recurring expenses as a result of the merger, other than certain non-cash expenses. 
Completion of the merger is subject to: HLTH and WebMD receiving required shareholder approvals; a requirement that the surviving company have a specified amount of cash as of the closing; completion of the sale by HLTH of either ViPS or Porex and the sale of HLTHs ARS investments; and other customary closing conditions. HLTH, which owns shares of WebMD constituting approximately 96% of the total number of votes represented by outstanding shares, has agreed to vote its shares of WebMD in favor of the merger. The transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2008. The precise timing will depend on, among other things, when the Registration Statement to be filed with respect to the transaction is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The terms of the merger agreement were negotiated between HLTH and a Special Committee of the Board of Directors of WebMD. The merger agreement was approved by the Board of WebMD based on the recommendations of the Special Committee and by the Board of HLTH. Raymond James and Associates, Inc. served as financial advisor to HLTH, and Morgan Joseph & Co. Inc. served as financial advisor to the WebMD Special Committee. OMelveny & Myers LLP served as legal counsel to HLTH, and Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP served as legal counsel to the Special Committee.

Accretive combination makes Diamond the number two global player in savory
snack category

  PR Newswire

  SAN FRANCISCO and CINCINNATI, April 5, 2011

SAN FRANCISCO and CINCINNATI, April 5, 2011 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Diamond
Foods , Inc. (NASDAQ: DMND) and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) today
announced the signing of a definitive agreement to merge the Pringles business
(""Pringles"") into Diamond Foods in a transaction valued at $2.35 billion.  

(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090115/CLTH035LOGO-a )

""Pringles is an iconic, billion dollar snack brand with significant global
manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure,"" said Michael J. Mendes,
Chairman, President and CEO of Diamond Foods. ""Our plan is to build upon the
brand equity Pringles has established in over 140 countries.  This strategic
combination will create an independent, global leader in the snack industry
with a focus on quality and innovative products.  Not only is this combination
immediately accretive, it also creates a platform that we believe will allow
us to build shareholder value for years to come.""

""We are confident Diamond Foods will be an excellent new home for our Snacks
employees,"" said Bob McDonald, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief
Executive Officer of P&G.  ""This is also a terrific deal for our shareholders
 maximizing value and minimizing earnings per share dilution.""

Pringles ® is the world's largest potato crisp(1) brand with sales in over 140
countries and manufacturing operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia.  The
global, iconic brand has been built over 45 years with a combination of
proprietary products, unique package design and significant advertising
investment.  Pringles will join Diamond's dynamic portfolio of brands, which
includes Diamond of California ® and Emerald ® nuts, Pop Secret ® microwave
popcorn and Kettle Brand ® potato chips, creating a premium snack-focused
company with total revenues of approximately $2.4 billion.

The combination will more than triple the size of Diamond's snack business
and:

  * Increase scale in U.S. grocery, mass merchandise, drug and convenience
    channels to gain greater merchandising and distribution influence;
  * Leverage Diamond's sales and distribution infrastructure through a more
    than doubling of snack sales in the U.S. and U.K., which are Pringles' two
    largest markets;
  * Gain a broader global manufacturing and supply chain platform, with access
    into key growth markets around the world, including Asia, Latin America
    and Central Europe;  
  * Increase Diamond's geographic diversity, with international sales
    accounting for approximately 49 percent of total revenues on a pro forma
    basis.  

Diamond Foods has a history of building, acquiring and energizing brands
through product and package innovation, efficient distribution and brand
investment.  The Company's total revenues have doubled and earnings per share
(EPS) have grown more than four-fold in the past five years(2).  

Diamond of California brand has grown from a single product offering to a full
line of culinary nuts over the past decade.  Today, Diamond is the category
leader with a market share ten times larger than the nearest branded
competitor(3).  Emerald, which was launched in 2004, is the fastest growing
and second largest brand in the snack nut category.  In 2008, the Company
acquired and successfully integrated Pop Secret microwave popcorn, and by
revitalizing the brand, Diamond has gained over 350 basis points of market
share to 26 percent today(3).  In 2010, the Company acquired Kettle Brand
potato chips and has fueled double-digit organic growth in its first year of
ownership while investing in new products and operational infrastructure.  

Financial Benefit for Diamond Foods Shareholders

Assuming Pringles had been owned for all of fiscal year 2011, the combined
company would be expected to deliver the following estimated financial results
on a pro forma basis for fiscal year 2011:

  * Net sales of approximately $2.4 billion;
  * Double-digit accretion to earnings per share (EPS), excluding merger and
    integration costs;
  * Estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
    (EBITDA), including $25 million in synergies, of approximately $398
    million to $410 million.

For fiscal year 2012, Diamond anticipates strong growth in its core business
with EPS of $2.85 to $2.98 per share on a standalone basis, an increase of 15
percent to 20 percent from the midpoint of its fiscal 2011 guidance range,
which represents a 30 percent increase over 2010 EPS.  

Combined results for Diamond plus the Pringles business for fiscal year 2012
will depend on the actual closing date of the transaction.  Assuming the
transaction closes by the end of calendar 2011, seven months of Pringles
performance would be included in the following expected results:

  * Fiscal 2012 total net sales are estimated to be approximately $1.8
    billion;
  * Fiscal 2012 EPS, before costs associated with the transaction and
    integration, are estimated to range from $3.00 to $3.10 per share, which
    reflects EPS accretion of 12 to 15 cents per share

The transaction is expected to significantly increase cash flow and accelerate
the de-levering of Diamond's balance sheet.  Pro forma leverage at closing is
projected to be below four times EBITDA, and projected to drop below three
times at the end of fiscal 2013.  Cash flow after brand investments and
capital expenditures is expected to approach $200 million in the first full
fiscal year after closing the merger.

Financial Value for P&G Shareholders

The taxefficient deal structure maximizes value for P&G shareholders and
minimizes annual earnings dilution.  The transaction will result in a one-time
earnings increase for P&G of approximately $1.5 billion after tax or
approximately $0.50 per share.  P&G expects only modest EPS dilution of $0.02
to $0.04 on an annualized basis. The stock exchange with Diamond will reduce
outstanding P&G shares, partially offsetting the Pringles earnings impact.
 Updated financial impacts will be provided when the transaction is completed.

Transaction Details

P&G expects the separation to occur through a ""split-off"" transaction in which
P&G shareholders can elect to participate in an exchange offer to exchange P&G
shares for shares of Diamond.  Under the terms of a split-merge agreement, P&G
will establish a separate entity to hold the Pringles business, which will be
distributed to electing P&G shareholders in a tax-efficient transaction with a
simultaneous merger with Diamond.  This ""Reverse Morris Trust"" transaction has
been approved by the boards of both companies.  We expect to finalize the
details of this transaction in the coming months.

The value of the transaction is $2.35 billion, comprising $1.5 billion in
Diamond common stock, consisting of 29.1 million shares for approximately 57
percent of the outstanding shares of the combined company, and the assumption
of $850 million of Pringles debt.  Diamond's existing shareholders would
continue to own approximately 43 percent of the combined company.

The parties have also agreed to a collar mechanism that would adjust the
amount of debt assumed by Diamond based upon Diamond's stock price during a
trading period prior to the commencement of the Exchange Offer.  The amount of
debt to be assumed by Diamond could increase by up to $200 million or decrease
by up to $150 million based on this adjustment mechanism.  

Diamond expects to incur one-time costs of approximately $100 million related
to the transaction over the next two years.  P&G also will provide Diamond
transition services for up to 12 months after closing.  

Leadership, Approvals and Timing

The combined business will be managed by Diamond's executive team and board of
directors, led by Michael J. Mendes, Chairman, President and CEO.  The
company's headquarters will remain in San Francisco, California.

This release contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections of Diamond's
and the combined company's results and the expected benefits of the
transaction.  Forward-looking statements necessarily depend on assumptions,
data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and are subject to risks
and uncertainties.  Actual results could differ materially from projections
made in this release.  Some factors that could cause actual results to differ
from our expectations include the timing of closing the transaction and the
possibility that the transaction is not consummated, risks of integrating
acquired businesses and entering markets in which we have limited experience,
availability and pricing of raw materials, impact of additional indebtedness,
loss of key suppliers, customers or employees, and an increase in competition.
 A more extensive list of factors that could materially affect our results can
be found in Diamond's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (""SEC"").  They are available publicly and on request from Diamond's
Investor Relations department.

For all items which relate to P&G and/or the combined business, all

new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements
are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could
differ significantly from our expectations. In addition to the risks and
uncertainties noted in this release or presentation, there are certain factors
that could cause actual results for any quarter or annual period to differ
materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made. These
include: (1) the ability to achieve business plans, including growing existing
sales and volume profitably despite high levels of competitive activity and an
increasing volatile economic environment, especially with respect to the
product categories and geographical markets (including developing markets) in
which the Company has chosen to focus; (2) the ability to successfully manage
ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities to achieve the cost and growth
synergies in accordance with the stated goals of these transactions without
impacting the delivery of base business objectives; (3) the ability to

growth strategies, while successfully identifying, developing and retaining
key employees, especially in key growth markets where the depth of skilled
employees is limited; (4) the ability to manage and maintain key customer
relationships; (5) the ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply
sources (including sole supplier and plant manufacturing sources); (6) the
ability to successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal requirements and
matters (including product liability, patent, intellectual property, and tax
policy), and to resolve pending matters within current estimates; (7) the
ability to resolve the pending competition law inquiries in Europe within
current estimates; (8) the ability to successfully implement, achieve and
sustain cost improvement plans in manufacturing and overhead areas, including
the Company's outsourcing projects; (9) the ability to successfully manage
currency (including currency issues in certain countries, such as Venezuela,
China and India), debt, interest rate and commodity cost exposures and
significant credit or liquidity issues; (10) the ability to manage continued
global political and/or economic uncertainty and disruptions, especially in
the Company's significant geographical markets, as well as any political
and/or economic uncertainty and disruptions due to a global or regional credit
crisis or terrorist and other hostile activities; (11) the ability to
successfully manage competitive factors, including prices, promotional
incentives and trade terms for products; (12) the ability to obtain patents
and respond to technological advances attained by competitors and patents
granted to competitors; (13) the ability to successfully manage increases in
the prices of raw materials used to make the Company's products; (14) the
ability to stay close to consumers in an era of increased media fragmentation;
(15) the ability to stay on the leading edge of innovation and maintain a
positive reputation on our brands; and (16) the ability to rely on and
maintain key information technology systems, including the transition of our
ordering, shipping and billing systems in North America and Western Europe to
a new system.  For additional information concerning factors that could cause
actual results to materially differ from those projected herein, please refer

HONG KONG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 03, 2008
The Coca-Cola Company announced today its intention to make cash
offers to purchase China Huiyuan Juice Group Limited, a Hong Kong
listed company which owns the Huiyuan juice business throughout China.

   The Coca-Cola business in China has been operating since 1979 and
is well known for its sparkling beverage brands such as Coca-Cola,
Sprite and Fanta. In the last few years, the Company has also
introduced a number of still beverage brands, including Guo Li Chen
(Minute Maid Pulpy) and Yuan Ye (Original Leaf Tea), with the
objective of offering consumers a wide range of beverage choices. In
line with this, the Company is seeking to further develop its beverage
business through this acquisition.

   ""Huiyuan is a long-established and successful juice brand in China
and is highly complementary to the Coca-Cola China business,"" said
Muhtar Kent, President and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company.

   ""This acquisition will deliver value to our shareholders and
provide a unique opportunity to strengthen our business in China,
especially since the juice segment is so dynamic and fast growing in
China. It is also further evidence of our deep commitment to China and
to providing Chinese consumers with the beverage choices that meet
their needs,"" Mr Kent said.

   If successful with the offers, the Company will use its expertise
as a global beverage company to further develop the Huiyuan brand to
address the evolving needs of consumers. There are anticipated
synergies that will drive operational efficiencies, particularly in
the Huiyuan business' production footprint and in Coca-Cola's
distribution and raw material purchasing capabilities.

   The making of the offers is subject to preconditions relating to
Chinese regulatory approvals.

   The Coca-Cola Company intends that the Huiyuan business will
continue to carry on its business, while reviewing its operations and
synergies over time.

   ""I am very pleased that the current Chairman of the Huiyuan
business, Mr Zhu, has agreed to take up the role as Honorary Chairman.
Both the Huiyuan business and The Coca-Cola Company will benefit from
his deep understanding of the beverage business in China, as well as
his on-going experience and advice,"" Mr Kent said. ""We are strongly
committed to building on the Huiyuan business' current brand,
improving the utilization of its fixed assets and enhancing
opportunities for employees of the Huiyuan business.""

   The Coca-Cola Company is offering HK$12.20 per share, and an
equivalent price for outstanding convertible bonds and options.

   The Company has accepted irrevocable undertakings from three
shareholders for acceptance of the offers, in aggregate representing
approximately 66 percent of the Huiyuan shares.

   Assuming full acceptance of the offers, the deal is valued at
approximately US$2.4billion. The transaction is expected to be
dilutive to the Company's earnings per share by $0.03 to $0.04 in the
first full year following completion of the acquisition and accretive
to earnings per share in year 3 after completion.

   The Company now expects to repurchase a total of $1 billion of its
stock for the full year.

    Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today announced that an agreement has
been reached with the Enodis plc Board of Directors on the terms of a
recommended US$2.1 billion cash offer to purchase the entire issued and to be
issued ordinary share capital of Enodis. The transaction also includes the
assumption of Enodis' net debt, which was US$210 million as of September 30,
2007, bringing the total fair market value to US$2.3 billion.

    Under the terms of the offer, Enodis shareholders will receive 280 pence in
cash for each share. In addition, prior to the transaction becoming effective,
Enodis will pay an interim dividend of 2 pence per share for the fiscal year
ending September 30, 2008. The transaction is structured as a court-sanctioned
scheme of arrangement under the laws of the U.K. The transaction is subject to
court approval in the U.K., the approval of Enodis shareholders, and
traditional regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions. ITW expects the
transaction to close in August 2008.

    Enodis, a leader in the commercial foodservice equipment industry, had
reported revenues of approximately US$1.6 billion for fiscal year ended
September 30, 2007. The company's extensive product line includes state-of
the-art food equipment mainly for fast food restaurants, institutions and
supermarket/grocery stores. Major products encompass cooking equipment, ice and
beverage dispensing equipment, and stand-alone refrigeration as well as
refrigerated display cases. Enodis' well known brand names include Frymaster,
Garland, Lincoln, Scotsman, Convotherm and Kysor Warren.

    ITW's existing food equipment businesses had revenues of US$1.9 billion in
2007 and feature highly-regarded products primarily for casual dining
restaurants, institutions and supermarket/grocery stores. Key products include
warewashing equipment, cooking and food processing equipment, refrigeration
equipment and ventilation and pollution control systems. ITW food equipment's
leading brand names include Hobart, Vulcan, Traulsen, Avery Berkel and Bonnet.
With more than 50 businesses in 23 countries, food equipment represented 12
percent of ITW's total company revenues in 2007.

    ""We strongly believe this cash offer brings significant value to Enodis'
shareholders,"" said David B. Speer, chairman and chief executive officer. ""The
ITW offer represents a 9 percent premium to a competitive offer and a 56
percent premium to Enodis' average closing price for the 12 months ending April
8, 2008.""

    ""We believe that the combination of ITW Food Equipment and Enodis will
create an expanded global food equipment platform with very complementary
strategic, operational and geographical growth positions,"" said Speer. ""The
collective businesses will have a significantly enhanced product portfolio in
addition to greater scale to compete even more effectively and successfully in
the global food equipment industry.""

    ""As we have done in past acquisitions, we intend to operate Enodis as a
stand alone business group within the Food Equipment segment. We also recognize
the importance of Enodis' workforce to our future success and look forward to
welcoming them into ITW's food equipment group,"" said Speer.

    ITW has scheduled a May 8 conference call to discuss this transaction at

Offer Represents Superior Value and Significant Premium to Avis
Budget's Hypothetical Offer

Deal Certainty With a Clear Regulatory Path

PARK RIDGE, NJ -- (Marketwire) -- 05/09/11 --   Hertz Global
Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: HTZ) (""Hertz"") today announced an exchange
offer for all outstanding shares of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group,
Inc. (NYSE: DTG) (""Dollar Thrifty""). Hertz will offer Dollar Thrifty
shareholders $72.00 per share (based on Hertz's closing stock price
on May 6, 2011), consisting of $57.60 in cash and 0.8546 shares of
Hertz. The offer represents:

*T

--  a 26% premium and 18% premium to Dollar Thrifty's 90-day and 60-day
    average share price, respectively;


--  a 7.6x multiple of Dollar Thrifty's LTM EBITDA for the period ended
    March 31, 2011; and


--  a 24% premium to the value of the entirely hypothetical price
    announced by Avis Budget Group, Inc. (""Avis Budget"") over seven months
    ago,


*T


based on the closing stock prices for Hertz and Avis Budget on May 6,
2011. These are substantial premiums, especially after taking into
account the significant takeover speculation premium already included
in Dollar Thrifty's current stock price.

The Hertz proposal offers immediate and superior value as well as
deal certainty to Dollar Thrifty shareholders. Moreover, it is a firm
offer in contrast to the entirely hypothetical Avis Budget
transaction.

Hertz's offer is not subject to any financing condition or
contingency.

The combination of Hertz and Dollar Thrifty would create a global,
multi-brand rental car leader offering customers a full range of
rental options through its market leading brands.

Commenting on the offer, Hertz Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
Mark P. Frissora said: ""We believe that the acquisition of Dollar
Thrifty b
y Hertz would be in the best interests of both companies'
shareholders and of rental car consumers, and that it will accelerate
Hertz's growth opportunities by leveraging the combined brand
portfolio and unparalleled value and service reputations of both
companies. To this end, we have today made a superior bid. We are
seeking a consensual business combination with Dollar Thrifty, and
are proceeding on an accelerated timetable in order to provide
immediate and certain value to Dollar Thrifty shareholders.""

Commensurate with Hertz's desire to expeditiously close this
transaction, Hertz is engaged in discussions with the FTC and has
commenced a process for the divestiture of its Advantage brand. Hertz
is highly confident that it will obtain FTC clearance for its
acquisition of Dollar Thrifty and is committed to a fast path
forward.

Mr. Frissora added, ""We have always known that antitrust
considerations would be pivotal in any transaction with Dollar
Thrifty, and that a combination of Avis Budget and Dollar Thrifty
would face serious antitrust obstacles. Avis Budget has been unable
to produce a viable antitrust remedy, despite an entire year of
discussions with the FTC with no end in sight. In contrast, we are
confident we can deliver a compelling proposal to the FTC centered
around the divestiture of our Advantage brand, and are committed to
working proactively to move through this process as quickly as
possible.""

Barclays Capital, Lazard, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche
Bank Securities are acting as financial advisors to Hertz. Barclays
Capital will serve as the dealer manager for the exchange offer.
Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP and Jones Day
are acting as legal advisors to Hertz. William Blair & Company is
acting as a financial advisor to Hertz in connection with the sale of
its Advantage brand.

The following is a copy of a letter Hertz today sent to Scott L.
Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dollar Thrifty:

May 9, 2011

Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc.
 5330 East 31st Street
 Tulsa,
Oklahoma 74135
 Attention: Scott L. Thompson, President and Chief
Executive Officer

Dear Scott:

As we discussed yesterday, Hertz is moving forward with an exchange
offer for all outstanding shares of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group,
Inc. Hertz is offering Dollar Thrifty shareholders $72.00 per share
(based on Hertz's closing stock price on May 6, 2011), consisting of
$57.60 in cash and 0.8546 shares of Hertz. We believe that Hertz's
offer represents a compelling opportunity for your shareholders to
realize superior value in the near term with a very high degree of
closing certainty.

Hertz is looking forward to proceeding on a consensual basis with the
support of the Dollar Thrifty Board of Directors and management team.
Our exchange offer is intended to provide Dollar Thrifty's
shareholders with a firm offer on an accelerated timetable in order
to position Hertz and Dollar Thrifty to close a deal and deliver
value to Dollar Thrifty's shareholders as soon as possible.

We believe we have made a superior offer that reflects Dollar
Thrifty's improved recent performance and outlook for 2011.
Specifically, our offer provides:

*T

--  a 26% premium and 18% premium to Dollar Thrifty's 90-day and 60-day
    average share price, respectively;
--  a 7.6x multiple of Dollar Thrifty's LTM EBITDA for the period ended
    March 31, 2011; and
--  a 24% premium to the value of the entirely hypothetical price
    announced by Avis Budget Group, Inc. over seven months ago of $45.79
    in cash and 0.6543 shares of Avis stock,
*T


based on the closing stock prices for Hertz and Avis on May 6, 2011.
These are substantial premiums, especially after taking into account
the significant takeover speculation premium already included in
Dollar Thrifty's current stock price.

Our offer delivers a high degree of closing certainty. We are engaged
in discussions with the Federal Trade Commission and have started a
process for the divestiture of our Advantage brand. We are highly
confident that we will obtain FTC clearance for the transaction and
are committed to a fast path forward. In contrast, Dollar Thrifty's
shareholders do not have any offer from Avis, and it has become clear
that Avis is either unwilling or unable to close on an offer even if
it made one because of serious antitrust obstacles.

Our offer is not subject to any financing condition or contingency.

This transaction is the highest priority for Hertz and has the
unanimous support of our Board of Directors and management team. I am
available to speak with you at any time, and I encourage you to have
your financial and legal advisors meet with Mark McMaster at Lazard
and Scott Barshay at Cravath, two of our principal advisors. We look
forward to working with you and your team to advance the best
interests of our respective shareholders, employees and customers.

Sincerely,

Mark P. Frissora
 Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.

REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2008
Electronic Arts Inc. (""EA"") (NASDAQ:ERTS) today announced that it
has extended its tender offer for all of the currently outstanding
shares of common stock (including the associated preferred stock
purchase rights) of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (""Take-Two"")
(NASDAQ:TTWO) to 11:59 p.m., EDT on May 16, 2008. The tender offer was
previously set to expire at 11:59 p.m., EDT, on April 18, 2008. EA
also amended its offer to reflect a price of $25.74 per share. The
price takes into consideration additional shares to be issued to
Zelnick Media following stockholder approval of the amendment to
Take-Two's incentive stock plan at its 2008 annual stockholders
meeting on April 17.

   Valued at approximately $2 billion in cash, EA's aggregate
consideration for Take-Two shares remains unchanged.

   EA continues to believe that the offer price is full and fair, and
that a transaction between Take-Two and EA is the most compelling
combination financially, strategically and operationally for all
parties.

   As of 5:00 p.m., EDT, on April 17, 2008, 6,432,787 shares of
Take-Two had been tendered in and not withdrawn from the tender offer.

                          INDEPENDENT NEWS & MEDIA PLC

                 REVISED OFFER TO THE BOARD OF APN NEWS & MEDIA

Dublin/London 24th January 2007: This announcement follows Independent News &
Media PLC's ('INM' or the 'Group') (ticker: INWS.I; INWS.L) announcement of 24th
November last, regarding its approach to the Board of APN News & Media Limited
(""APN"") in respect of a possible leveraged buy-out of APN.

INM confirmed today that it has, in conjunction with Providence Equity Partners
and The Carlyle Group (together the ""Consortium""), made an all-cash offer for
the entire issued share capital of APN at a price of A$6.05 per share.

This revised offer - which values APN at approximately A$3.8 billion (c. 2.3
billion) - is subject to a number of conditions, including confirmatory due
diligence, implementation of the new media laws in Australia, and such other
regulatory and board approvals as may apply.

If concluded, INM shall reinvest a significant part of its likely proceeds from
the Consortium's offer, so that it remains the largest shareholder in APN. It is
envisaged that INM will manage and run APN, which will no longer be a subsidiary
of INM, but will be accounted for as an associate company.

The balance of the cash to be received by INM as a result of the Consortium's
offer will be applied towards the acceleration of the Group's expansion in its
global markets, to the maximisation of shareholder returns and to general
corporate purposes.

Acquire Real Estate Portfolio



    NEW YORK, March 1 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- NorthStar Realty Finance
(NYSE: NRF) today announced that a joint venture among affiliates of
NorthStar, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and a well regarded publicly traded real
estate finance company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire a
diversified portfolio of multi-family properties from a leading developer and
operator of long-term incentive tax credit properties.  Each of the joint
venture partners will equally share in the approximately $525 million purchase
price, inclusive of estimated fees and expenses, and the total transaction
value, including assumed debt, will be approximately $1.9 billion.  The assets
to be acquired consist of notes, general partnership interests and incentive
fees relating to the underlying multi-family properties.  The transaction,
which is subject to a 120 day due diligence period and obtaining limited
partner, lender and other consents, is expected to be completed in the third
or fourth quarter of 2007.

    David T. Hamamoto, NorthStar's president and chief executive officer
commented, ""We are pleased to have partnered with two very well regarded
investment and finance companies to have the opportunity to acquire a diverse
portfolio of financial and real estate assets that we believe will generate an
attractive and stable income stream for our stockholders over an anticipated
15-year hold period.  This deal illustrates the opportunities available to
investors who are able to work through complicated structures to generate
compelling and off-market investments.  We believe that this investment, if
completed, will be at a substantial discount to the estimated replacement cost
of the underlying assets and that our expected yield relative to our basis in
the assets would be extremely difficult to replicate on a long-term basis in
today's market.""

  Share in Cash

 $1.1 Billion Proposal Provides Immediate and Significant Premium to Georgia
                              Gulf Shareholders

Business Wire

HOUSTON -- January 13, 2012

Westlake Chemical Corporation (NYSE: WLK) announced today that it has
submitted a proposal to Georgia Gulf Corporation (NYSE: GGC) to acquire all of
the outstanding shares of Georgia Gulf for $30.00 per share in cash. The
proposal represents a 51% premium to Georgia Gulfs 30-day volume-weighted
average share price of $19.82. Westlakes proposal is not subject to a
financing condition. Westlake expects the transaction would be accretive to
earnings in the first fiscal year after the close of the transaction. Westlake
also noted that it has acquired shares representing approximately 4.8% of the
outstanding common shares of Georgia Gulf.

The combination of Westlake and Georgia Gulf would create one of the leading
North American olefins, vinyls, and building products producers, with
increased scale in the growing global vinyls market and with additional growth
opportunities. Acquiring Georgia Gulf would enable Westlake to become a
leading PVC resins producer and vinyl-based building products supplier, and
would provide Westlake with opportunities to expand its global product
offerings.

Albert Chao, Westlakes President and Chief Executive Officer, said, We
believe that our proposal represents a unique opportunity to deliver
significant and immediate value to Georgia Gulf stockholders. As such, we are
surprised and disappointed that Georgia Gulfs management has been unwilling
to engage in substantive discussions with us.

Since the initial delivery of our proposal on September 20, 2011, we have
made numerous attempts to engage in meaningful dialogue with Georgia Gulf and
have expressed our willingness to explore, pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement, whether opportunities exist that would justify
increasing our proposal price. However, Georgia Gulf has been unwilling to
provide us with information that would allow us to explore these opportunities
or to enter into substantive discussions. We urge the Georgia Gulf Board to
act in the best interests of its shareholders by meeting with us to seriously
discuss our compelling proposal, Mr. Chao continued.

In a letter sent to Georgia Gulf today, Westlake stressed that it would prefer
a negotiated transaction with Georgia Gulf, but stated that it has determined
that this step was now necessary. Westlake has retained Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC as its financial advisors, Vinson
& Elkins LLP and Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell LLP as its legal advisors,
MacKenzie Partners, Inc., and other advisors. For additional information about
Westlakes proposal, please visit www.WestlakeGGC.AcquisitionProposal.com.

Below is the full text of the most recent letter sent from Westlake to Georgia
Gulf:

January 13, 2012

Board of Directors
Georgia Gulf Corporation
115 Perimeter Center Place
Suite 460
Atlanta, GA 30346

Attention: Mr. Mark Noetzel, Chairman of the Board

Dear Members of the Board:

We are disappointed by your continued rejection of our proposal to acquire all
of the outstanding shares of Georgia Gulf Corporation (Georgia Gulf) for
$30.00 per share in cash, which we first offered on September 20, 2011. The
$30.00 per share offer price represents a significant 66% premium to Georgia
Gulfs volume-weighted average closing share price of $18.02 since our initial
offer. Notwithstanding our compelling proposal and our repeated attempts at
engagement, you have been unwilling to discuss value or to commence
negotiations with us despite the opportunity to provide your stockholders with
immediate liquidity at a sizeable premium in an uncertain economic
environment. Since we first made our proposal, your stock has traded as low as
$12.84 per share, yet we have confirmed our $30 per share offer without a
financing condition and you have not engaged.

We held out some hope that our meeting with Georgia Gulf management on
December 22, 2011, would finally allow the parties to have a serious dialogue
about our proposal. After all, we have for months expressed our willingness to
explore with you, pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement, whether
opportunities exist that would justify increasing our offer to make it even
more attractive to the Georgia Gulf stockholders. Unfortunately, rather than
taking the opportunity to demonstrate additional value or enter into
substantive discussions, you continued to insist on a standstill arrangement
that would unreasonably restrain your stockholders ability to timely consider
our proposal. Moreover, you have insisted on this restrictive standstill
arrangement without any commitment on your part to respond to requests for
information or to negotiate with us in good faith. Asking for such a
constraint without providing us any reason to believe you would support a
transaction at any price is untenable from our perspective, and we suspect
your stockholders would share this perspective too.

Consequently, we have decided to make the terms of our all-cash proposal
public. Given the significant premium and near term liquidity, we are
confident that Georgia Gulfs stockholders will enthusiastically embrace it.

We have put considerable time and resources into evaluating this transaction
and developing our proposal. Our board of directors supports it and we have
sufficient cash and borrowing capacity to fully fund this cash transaction. We
are committed to completing a transaction with Georgia Gulf and we stand ready
to meet and discuss next steps towards a mutually beneficial negotiated
transaction with you and your financial and legal advisors at any time and in
any location. As we have stressed since our initial correspondence in
September, we very much prefer to negotiate a transaction with Georgia Gulf,
but we have determined that making your stockholders aware of our proposal is
necessary. We already have acquired shares representing approximately 4.8% of
the outstanding common shares of Georgia Gulf. We also have engaged Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC as our financial advisors,
Vinson & Elkins LLP and Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell LLP as our legal
advisors, MacKenzie Partners, Inc., and other advisors in relation to this
transaction.

We look forward to speaking to you and your stockholders about our attractive
proposal to combine Westlake and Georgia Gulf.

Sincerely yours,

Albert Chao
President and Chief Executive Officer

  PR Newswire

  NEW ORLEANS, and NOVI, Mich., Dec. 5, 2011

NEW ORLEANS, and NOVI, Mich., Dec. 5, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Entergy Corporation
(NYSE: ETR) and ITC Holdings Corp. (NYSE: ITC) today announced that the Boards
of Directors of both companies have approved a definitive agreement under
which Entergy will divest and then merge its electric transmission business
into ITC.

Entergy's electric transmission business consists of approximately 15,700
miles of interconnected transmission lines at voltages of 69kV and above and
associated substations across its utility service territory in the Mid-South.
Following the completion of the transaction, ITC will become one of the
largest electric transmission companies in the U.S., with over 30,000 miles of
transmission lines, spanning from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast.

""This transaction furthers ITC's position as a preeminent electric
transmission owner, operator and developer in the U.S. and also serves to
validate the benefits of the independent transmission model,"" said Joseph L.
Welch, ITC chairman, president and CEO. ""By combining these businesses, we
will significantly enhance the scale of our operations and financial resources
as we continue to invest in electric transmission infrastructure for the
benefit of customers, resulting in improved reliability, reduced system
congestion and greater access to competitive energy markets. The transaction
will also strengthen our existing transmission platform through the addition
of sizable new service territories, thus enhancing our ability to deliver
long-term sustainable growth.

""This is an attractive and natural strategic fit for ITC that provides
benefits for stakeholders, including customers, employees, local communities
and shareholders. Customers in Entergy's service territory will benefit from
the commitment that ITC makes to the regions and communities we serve, which
is the cornerstone of our business and furthers our mission to be a
best-in-class transmission provider and good corporate citizen. We have a
strong track record of efficiently and effectively integrating systems and
anticipate a seamless transition for Entergy customers,"" Mr. Welch said.

Entergy chairman and CEO J. Wayne Leonard said, ""We are pleased to have
reached this agreement with ITC, and after careful consideration, we believe
this transaction is without a doubt the right decision for our customers and
other stakeholders. The transaction enables us to maintain the financial
flexibility necessary to address the growing challenges our industry faces,
including substantial infrastructure investment. We believe ITC's independent
transmission company structure is the best model to drive economic efficiency,
achieve an open and robust market, and provide access for low-cost generation
and efficient transmission use and expansion in the country.""

Transaction Details and Approvals

The terms of the transaction agreements call for Entergy to divest its
electric transmission business to a newly-formed entity, Mid South TransCo LLC
(""Transco""), and distribute this newly-formed entity to its shareholders in
the form of a tax-free spin-off. Transco will then merge with and into a
newly-created merger subsidiary of ITC in an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust
transaction. Prior to the merger, ITC expects to effectuate a $700 million
recapitalization, currently anticipated to take the form of a one-time special
dividend to its shareholders. The merger will result in shareholders of
Entergy receiving 50.1 percent of the shares of pro forma ITC in exchange for
their shares of Transco, with existing shareholders of ITC owning the
remaining 49.9 percent of the combined company. The transaction is expected to
be immediately value accretive to ITC shareholders. Rate base for pro forma
ITC is projected to be approximately $7.1 billion by year-end 2013.

Entergy expects to receive gross cash proceeds of $1.775 billion from
indebtedness that will be incurred in connection with the transaction, and
this indebtedness will be assumed by ITC at the close of the merger. In
addition, ITC anticipates issuing approximately $700 million of unsecured debt
at the holding company. The combination is expected to enhance the overall
credit quality for pro forma ITC due to its increased size, scale and
financial resources and has been structured to preserve ITC's existing strong
credit metrics. Entergy expects to utilize most of the cash proceeds to retire
debt associated with the transmission business at its utility operating
companies and the balance for debt reduction at the parent, Entergy. The
merger is expected to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income
tax purposes for both companies and Entergy's shareholders.

Completion of the transaction is expected in 2013 subject to the satisfaction
of certain closing conditions, including the necessary approvals of Entergy's
retail regulators, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and ITC
shareholders.

Compelling Financial and Strategic Benefits

Financial Flexibility and Growth

Within the U.S., projected capital investment in the electric utility industry
is forecasted to be in the $2 trillion range over the next 20 years. By
divesting its transmission business, Entergy is increasing its flexibility of
investment alternatives and protecting the credit quality of Entergy and its
operating subsidiaries. In turn, as a transmission-only utility, ITC will
address the transmission system needs of the region to support efficient
infrastructure investment by improving access to capital for the transmission
business.

The addition of the Entergy transmission business expands ITC's current
business model and adds sizable new markets to its operating and development
portfolio. This will serve to diversify and enhance ITC's long-term growth
prospects by providing additional avenues for investment in needed
transmission infrastructure that will benefit customers in the Entergy region.

Operational Excellence

Combining the best operating practices of both companies, including the ITC
transmission-only model and Entergy employees' knowledge and experience, will
benefit overall system performance. The transaction will allow ITC to bring
its experience and track record of safe and reliable operations to the Entergy
region. ITC's commitment to operational excellence will ensure continued
strengthening of overall grid performance while emphasizing safety,
reliability, compliance and project execution. ITC will fully utilize
Entergy's world-class storm restoration process and leverage the combined
expertise to ensure that customers in the Entergy territory receive the same
quality storm response efforts they have had in the past.

Independent and Transparent ITC Model

The independent transmission model provides singular focus on transmission
system performance, planning and operations. This model also aligns with
national policy objectives to facilitate investment in regional and
inter-regional transmission, advances open access initiatives and promotes
access to competitive energy markets.

Seamless For Customers, Benefiting Communities

This transaction will be seamless for Entergy's retail customers, who will
continue to be customers of Entergy utilities and will receive the same high
quality service from their local utility. Entergy's utility companies will
continue to own and operate the local distribution and generation assets. Both
companies are committed to ensuring that the necessary procedures and
personnel are in place to maintain Entergy's high standards in this area.

Increased local investments in the areas in which the companies operate should
enhance the local and regional economies and stimulate job creation. Total
annual investments for the Entergy transmission business are expected to range
from approximately $400 million to $525 million through 2014. In addition, ITC
brings a commitment to the local communities where it operates through
partnerships and support for charities and other organizations that benefit
residents. As part of a separate effort, Entergy continues to seek the
necessary approvals to join the Midwest Independent System Operator (""MISO"")
regional transmission organization.

Leadership Team, Employees and Headquarters

Upon the closing of the merger, ITC's Board of Directors will appoint two new
independent directors who will have transmission industry knowledge and
familiarity with the region in which Entergy operates. ITC's management team
will remain intact for the combined business, but will be supplemented with
key leadership personnel from Entergy's transmission business to ensure a
successful integration and consistency of operations. 

Following completion of the transaction, approximately 750 current Entergy
positions will be integrated into ITC. In addition, ITC will assume operations
of the Entergy transmission and transmission-related facilities throughout the
region and further establish a regional presence within the Entergy footprint,
including maintaining a regional headquarters in Jackson, Mississippi. ITC's
corporate headquarters are located in Novi, Michigan.

Business Wire

WILMINGTON, Mass. & SHANGHAI -- April 26, 2010

Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (NYSE: CRL), a leading global
provider of research models and associated services and of preclinical drug
development services, and WuXi PharmaTech (Cayman) Inc. (NYSE: WX), a leading
drug research and development outsourcing company with expertise in discovery
chemistry and with operations in China and the United States, today announced
that they have signed a definitive agreement under which Charles River and
WuXi will combine in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $1.6
billion.

The combined company, which will retain the name Charles River, will offer an
expanded portfolio of products and outsourced services to multinational
pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies and academic and
government institutions who increasingly seek the flexibility to access high
quality, early-stage drug development expertise from chemistry to man from one
global company.

This transaction revolutionizes the contract research landscape by creating
the only global contract research organization, or CRO, to offer fully
integrated research and drug development services from molecule creation to
first-in-human testing, said James C. Foster, Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Charles River.

We regard this as a transformational transaction that sets a new standard in
the outsourced drug development services industry, Mr. Foster continued. For
the first time, our existing and potential clients will be able to obtain
support for their early-stage drug development needs from one company with
unparalleled scientific depth and breadth in chemistry and biology. We will be
a more valuable strategic partner to our clients by offering both upstream and
downstream support for their efforts to bring new drugs to market. Further, we
will be able to provide our integrated portfolio of products and services
globally, affording clients the opportunity to work in the locale which suits
them best: North America, Europe or China.

Dr. Ge Li, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of WuXi, said: This
combination represents a true win-win scenario that significantly expands the
global reach and growth opportunities for both companies. As a result of this
transaction, Charles River will be able to immediately expand its presence in
China and avail itself of WuXis expertise in chemistry services, while
simultaneously, WuXi will be in a position to accelerate its good laboratory
practice (GLP) toxicology capabilities. Together, we will offer our clients
unparalleled support to meet their early-stage drug development needs.

Mr. Foster concluded, We have tremendous respect for WuXi and its skilled
team, who have built a market-leading company with a significant presence in
China, a region many of our clients consider to be the new frontier for drug
development. The combination of WuXi and Charles River brings together two
companies with a shared mission: to support and accelerate our clients drug
development efforts. Both companies corporate cultures share a commitment to
scientific expertise, exceeding clients expectations, dedication to
employees, and building a valuable enterprise for shareholders.

Leadership and Integration

Mr. Foster will continue to lead the combined company and Dr. Li will become
Corporate Executive Vice President and President of Global Discovery and China
Services, which will be a new reporting segment for the Company. In addition,
Dr. Li and two other WuXi directors will join the Board of Charles River.

As soon as practicable, Charles River and WuXi will form a joint integration
team to fully assess the logistics of the combination and optimization of our
resources.

Financial Implications

As a result of the combination, Charles River expects to achieve pre-tax cost
savings and synergies of approximately $20 million on an annualized basis,
beginning in 2011, principally from consolidation of corporate infrastructure,
as well as from operating efficiencies. The transaction is expected to be
neutral to slightly accretive to 2011 earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis
and increasingly accretive thereafter. Items excluded from non-GAAP results
are expected to include all deal-related costs including amortization. Charles
River also expects revenue growth to increase as a result of a broader
portfolio of essential products and services, a larger global footprint and
the opportunity to sell upstream and downstream to the client base.

Financial Terms of the Transaction

Under the terms of the agreement, which was unanimously approved by the boards
of directors of both companies, the total consideration to be paid will be
$21.25 per WuXi American Depositary Share (ADS), subject to the collar
described below. Each WuXi ADS will be exchanged for $11.25 in cash and $10.00
of Charles River common stock determined by an exchange ratio. This exchange
ratio will be determined by dividing $10.00 by the weighted average Charles
River common stock closing price as reported on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) for the 20-day trading period ending on the second business day prior
to closing (Charles River Average Price). However, if the Charles River
Average Price is equal to or greater than $43.1726, then the exchange ratio
will be fixed at 0.2316, and if the Charles River Average Price is equal to or
less than $37.1486, then the exchange ratio will be fixed at 0.2692. Please
note, each WuXi ADS trading on the NYSE represents eight (8) WuXi ordinary
shares. Based on WuXis closing stock price of $16.57 on April 23, 2010, the
transaction represents a premium to WuXi shareholders of 28%. Based on the
30-day average closing price of $15.45, the premium is 38%. The exchange of
WuXi shares for cash and Charles River shares is expected to be taxable to
WuXis shareholders under U.S. tax law. Charles River stock will continue to
be listed on the NYSE under the symbol CRL.

Financing

Charles River intends to finance the cash portion of the transaction through
balance sheet cash on hand and one or more sources of new debt financing.
Charles River has received a financing commitment for a $1.25 billion credit
facility from J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Approvals and Time to Close

The transaction is subject to approval by each companys stockholders and the
satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Subject
to the satisfaction of these conditions, the companies anticipate completing
the transaction by the fourth quarter of 2010.

Business Wire

SUNNYVALE, Calif. & SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- May 20, 2009

NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and Data Domain (NASDAQ:DDUP) announced today they have
entered into a definitive agreement under which NetApp will acquire all of the
outstanding shares of Data Domain common stock for $25 per share in cash and
stock. The transaction is valued at approximately $1.5B, net of Data Domains
cash.

This combination is a great opportunity for both NetApp and Data Domain,
said Dan Warmenhoven, chairman and CEO of NetApp. Data Domain is an
innovative high-growth company with a complementary product line ideally
suited for multi-vendor environments where customers want to minimize their
use of tape for backup. NetApp has the distribution channels and international
reach to offer Data Domain products to more customers, accelerating growth and
market adoption. The combination of our two companies will increase NetApps
reputation for delivering both outstanding efficiency and operational
breakthroughs to customers worldwide.

Customers will benefit from the robust worldwide sales, support, partner, and
service network NetApp can bring to Data Domain products, further enabling
customers to deploy Data Domain products on a global basis. NetApp and Data
Domain channel partners will benefit from the inclusion of the innovative Data
Domain product line into the NetApp Partner Program.

NetApp intends to operate Data Domain as a product line within NetApps
product operations organization. The Data Domain sales organization will be
integrated with NetApp sales to maximize momentum and access new accounts.

Our objective will be to amplify Data Domains success, grow Data Domains
revenues as quickly as todays economy will allow, and create systems and
incentives within NetApp to nurture Data Domain to its fullest potential,
added Warmenhoven. We will focus on new customer acquisition and maximum
market share expansion. Their existing customers should see the benefits of
NetApps broader scale and support capabilities.

Notwithstanding the rapid record sales growth Data Domain has experienced
over the past 5 years, with NetApps distribution channel and customer base,
we have an opportunity to accelerate even further, said Frank Slootman,
president and CEO of Data Domain.

Portfolio Synergy

The Data Domain portfolio brings a complementary offering to NetApp, expanding
NetApps reach in the market for heterogeneous disk-based backup. Today,
NetApps heterogeneous backup offering (with its VTL product line) provides
installations with disk-based solutions to augment their tape backup
infrastructure. Data Domains portfolio will extend NetApps ability to
compete in the increasing number of installations wanting to minimize their
reliance on tape. The Data Domain acquisition increases NetApps ability to
capitalize on the growth of disk-based backup adoption, a trend accelerated by
the economics of deduplication.

Transaction Details

The Board of Directors of Data Domain has unanimously approved the
transaction. We anticipate that the deal will close in 60-120 days subject to
customary closing conditions including regulatory approval.

More details on this transaction will be available on NetApps quarterly
results conference call which will be broadcast live on the Internet at
http://investors.netapp.com on Wednesday, May 20, 2009, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific
Time. The conference call will also be available live in a listen-only format
at (800) 638-4930 in the United States and (617) 614-3944 outside the United
States. The pass code for both numbers is 57400475. A replay will be available
for 72 hours following the completion of the live call by dialing (888)
286-8010 in the United States and (617) 801-6888 outside the United States,
using replay code 92143343. The Webcast replay will be posted on NetApps Web
site for at least one year. Other materials will be available on netapp.com.

Cash; Transaction Valued at $1.7 Billion


Provides Premium of Approximately 36% Over Implied Value of ADC Transaction

Expected to Be Accretive to Earnings Per Share in First Year After Closing

Combination Would Create Global Leader in Providing ""Last Mile"" Solutions for
Communications Networks


    HICKORY, N.C., Aug. 7 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- CommScope, Inc.
(NYSE: CTV) announced today that it is proposing to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of Andrew Corporation (Nasdaq: ANDW) for $9.50 per share in
cash. CommScope's all-cash proposal represents a premium of approximately 36%
over the $6.97 per share value Andrew's shareholders would receive under the
existing merger agreement between Andrew and ADC Telecommunications, Inc.
(Nasdaq: ADCT), based on the closing price of ADC's common stock on August 4,
2006, the last trading day before CommScope's proposal was made public.
CommScope's proposal also represents a premium of approximately 20% over
Andrew's per share closing price of $7.89 on August 4, 2006.

    The proposal, which was unanimously approved by CommScope's Board of
Directors, is valued at approximately $1.7 billion, including assumption of
approximately $186 million of Andrew net debt.  This represents aggregate
additional consideration of approximately $404 million over the current value
provided to Andrew's shareholders under the existing ADC / Andrew merger
agreement.  The merger is expected to be accretive to CommScope's earnings per
share in the first year after closing, excluding any related special items.
Assuming the timeline set forth in the proposal letter, it is anticipated that
the proposed transaction would close in early 2007.

    CommScope expects the combined company to be a leader in virtually every
aspect of ""last mile"" communications: structured cabling solutions for the
business enterprise, broadband cable for HFC applications and wireless
communications infrastructure.  In addition to the compelling strategic fit of
Andrew and CommScope, the combination of the companies' respective operations
is expected to result in meaningful sales, operating and cost synergies.
CommScope has a strong global track record of managing its businesses to
create shareholder value.  Moreover, CommScope's executive management team has
extensive experience in all the product areas in which Andrew currently
operates.  Given CommScope's manufacturing discipline and commitment to
operational excellence, and based on its review of publicly available
information, the Company expects to achieve annual cost savings of
approximately $30 million to $50 million in the first full year after
completion of the transaction and approximately $70 million to $90 million in
the second full year after completion.

    ""We believe that our all-cash proposal is extremely compelling for Andrew
shareholders and provides Andrew shareholders superior value over that
contemplated by the existing merger agreement with ADC,"" said Frank Drendel,
CommScope's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  ""Under our proposal, Andrew
shareholders will receive a substantial cash premium for their shares without
the significant uncertainties inherent in ADC's proposed stock-for-stock
merger transaction.  We believe that Andrew's Board of Directors and
shareholders will find our all-cash proposal superior to the ADC transaction.
For CommScope shareholders, we believe this transaction represents a unique
opportunity to become even more competitive and profitable, with an even
stronger and more diverse revenue stream.  We look forward to Andrew's Board
and management team carefully considering our all-cash proposal and moving
quickly with them towards a definitive merger agreement.

    ""The combination of Andrew and CommScope is a logical step in the
continued growth and development of CommScope,"" continued Mr. Drendel.  ""The
combination will create a global leader in providing solutions for the 'last
mile' of communications networks.  The 'last mile' provides the final link
between broadband and content-rich services and the end-user, including homes,
business enterprises and wireless customers.  Andrew is an excellent fit with
our portfolio, and provides us with the opportunity to build upon CommScope's
innovative carrier technologies and Andrew's strong global wireless channel
and brand.  The transaction will also expand our global footprint and our
worldwide growth opportunities by combining CommScope's leading global channel
in enterprise applications with Andrew's in-building wireless solutions.""

    The transaction would be financed through a combination of cash on hand
and debt financing.  CommScope has received commitment letters from Bank of
America, N.A. and Wachovia Bank, N.A. (and their respective affiliates) for
the financing of the transaction, which are subject to due diligence and other
customary conditions.  CommScope's offer, however, is not subject to a
financing condition. Upon completion of the transaction, with the anticipated
free cash flow generated by the combined company and divestitures of non-core
businesses, CommScope intends to reduce the company's debt on a consistent
basis.

    Below is the text of the letter that was sent this morning to Ralph
Faison, Andrew's President and Chief Executive Officer:


    August 7, 2006

    Mr. Ralph E. Faison
    President and Chief Executive Officer
    Andrew Corporation
    3 Westbrook Corporate Center
    Suite 900
    Westchester, Illinois 60154

    Dear Ralph:

    We are pleased to submit this proposal to combine the businesses of our
two companies, subject to the terms and conditions discussed below.  We
believe that the combination of the businesses of Andrew Corporation
(""Andrew"") and CommScope, Inc. (""CommScope"") is a compelling strategic fit
that will build upon Andrew's and CommScope's highly complementary operating
assets.  This is an outstanding opportunity for both of our companies that
offers significant value for Andrew's shareholders. We believe our proposal is
superior, both financially and strategically, to the offer contemplated in
your merger agreement with ADC Telecommunications, Inc. (""ADC"").

    We have followed the progress of the proposed merger between Andrew and
ADC since its announcement on May 31, 2006.  We note that since the
announcement of the ADC-Andrew merger, ADC's share price has declined
approximately 45%.  Based on the exchange ratio in the ADC-Andrew merger
agreement, and ADC's current market price of $12.22 per share, Andrew
shareholders would receive only $6.97 per share of value under such merger
agreement.  We also note that while Andrew has reported results consistent
with market expectations, ADC's recent pre-announcement of reduced guidance
for the current quarter and fiscal year appears to have further eroded
shareholder confidence in the proposed combination. We believe our proposal
provides superior value to Andrew's shareholders in a market environment where
the value of the proposed transaction with ADC has been subject to
considerable uncertainty.

    Our Board of Directors has unanimously authorized us to propose an
alternative transaction in which CommScope would acquire all of Andrew's
outstanding shares at a price of $9.50 per share in an all-cash merger.  This
proposal represents a premium of 36% over the current value of ADC's proposal,
based on ADC's closing price on August 4, 2006 of $12.22 per share, and a 20%
premium over Andrew's closing price on August 4, 2006 of $7.89 per share.  Our
proposal is not subject to any financing condition.  Both Bank of America,
N.A. and Wachovia Bank, N.A. (and their respective affiliates) have agreed to
provide the financing necessary to consummate our proposed transaction,
subject to due diligence and other customary conditions.  In addition, we have
reviewed the regulatory approvals that will be necessary to complete the
transaction and will commit to obtaining these approvals as expeditiously as
possible.

    Our proposal is based on the publicly available information regarding
Andrew, and is therefore subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence.
However, as you are aware, we are familiar with most aspects of the Andrew
business and expect our diligence review to be relatively short.  We would
expect to be able to complete our diligence review promptly after receiving
access to the needed information.  Our proposal is conditioned on negotiation
of a mutually acceptable merger agreement. Beyond those changes needed to
reflect an all-cash deal and any changes you may require, we expect the terms
of our merger agreement would be similar to the merger agreement entered into
between Andrew and ADC.  Shortly after completion of the due diligence we
expect to be able to enter into this negotiated agreement.

    Taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory and other
requirements, we expect that the proposed transaction could close in early
2007.

    We believe that Andrew's Board of Directors should readily find that our
proposal is a ""Superior Proposal,"" as defined by your existing merger
agreement, and that entering into a combination with CommScope would be in the
best interests of Andrew's shareholders.

    To the extent you are permitted to do so under your merger agreement with
ADC, we and our advisors are prepared to meet with you and your advisors
immediately to discuss our proposal and finalize an agreement as expeditiously
as possible.  We both have significant transaction experience and we believe
that working together will create value for our stockholders.

    We request a response to this letter by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on
Friday, August 11, 2006.  Our proposal will expire at that time.  We look
forward to hearing from you.  Please contact me at your earliest convenience.


     Sincerely,
     /s/ Frank M. Drendel
     Frank M. Drendel
     Chairman and Chief Executive Officer


    CommScope's proposal is subject to completion of a due diligence review of
Andrew, as well as satisfaction of other customary conditions, including
approval by Andrew's Board and shareholders and clearance under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and any other applicable law or
regulation.  The proposed transaction is not subject to any financing
contingency.

    Banc of America Securities LLC is acting as financial advisor to CommScope
and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP and Robinson, Bradshaw &
Hinson, P.A. are acting as legal counsel.

    HOUSTON, April 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Grey Wolf, Inc. (""Grey Wolf"")
(Amex: GW) and Basic Energy Services, Inc. (""Basic Energy Services"")
(NYSE: BAS) today announced that their Boards of Directors have approved a
definitive agreement to combine the two businesses in a ""merger of equals"".
Based upon closing prices for each company's common stock as of April 18,
2008, the estimated enterprise value of the combined company would be
approximately $2.9 billion.  The combined company will be named Grey Wolf,
Inc., have its corporate offices in Houston, establish incorporation in the
state of Delaware and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
""GW"".

    Under the terms of the agreement, Grey Wolf shareholders will receive
$1.82 in cash and 0.2500 shares of new Grey Wolf for each share of Grey Wolf
they currently own.  Based on this exchange ratio, each stockholder of Grey
Wolf will receive one share of new Grey Wolf for each four shares of Grey Wolf
in addition to the cash consideration.  Basic Energy Services shareholders
will receive $6.70 in cash and 0.9195 shares of new Grey Wolf for each share
of Basic Energy Services they currently own.  The total number of shares
outstanding of the combined company, which is reflective of the above exchange
ratios applied to both companies' respective current shares outstanding, will
be approximately 85 million shares.  Pro forma net debt as of December 31,
2007 will be approximately $960 million.  The combined company intends to
dedicate a substantial amount of its free cash flow to the repayment of the
debt while at the same time fully funding and implementing its significant,
value-adding growth initiatives.

    The greater financial strength of the combined company will enable it to
return approximately $600 million in cash to the combined shareholder base
while retaining financial flexibility to invest for future growth.  The
financing will be provided by affiliates of UBS Investment Bank and Goldman,
Sachs & Co.  The cash is being issued to the two sets of shareholders
proportionate to pro forma ownership of the combined company, which will be
approximately 54% owned by current Grey Wolf shareholders and 46% owned by
current Basic Energy Services shareholders.

    The combination will create an organization with approximately 7,500
personnel, providing a broad range of drilling and oilfield well services.
The combined company will have 395 well servicing and 130 drilling rigs as
well as a suite of other oilfield service assets, pro forma sales and EBITDA
of approximately $1,784 million and $632 million, respectively (for the full
year ending 12/31/07).  Pro forma sales (for the full year ending 12/31/07)
would be approximately 53% from contract drilling, 19% from well servicing,
15% from fluid services and 13% from completion and remedial services.

    Current Grey Wolf Chairman, President and CEO, Thomas P. Richards, who
will serve as Grey Wolf, Inc.'s Chairman following the merger, said, ""This is
an exciting opportunity for our shareholders, our customers and our people.
Grey Wolf's premium land drilling rig fleet complements Basic Energy Service's
premium land-based well servicing equipment.  With approximately 50% of Basic
Energy Service's business focused on oil and approximately 95% of Grey Wolf's
business focused on natural gas, this transaction results in a company with a
diversified revenue stream in terms of exposure to oil and gas opportunities,
involvement through the life of the well from drilling to production to well
abandonment and a very broad geographic coverage, all of which is consistent
with our stated strategic goal.  We are confident that our valued customers
will respond positively to this merger with the combined company's enhanced
ability to satisfy their needs.  Grey Wolf has an outstanding management team,
as well as operational and support staff, which when combined with Basic
Energy Services' organization, will produce a best-in-class team.""

    Ken Huseman, who will serve as Chief Executive Officer of Grey Wolf, Inc.
after the merger, said, ""This combination achieves the goal of moving Basic
Energy Services forward in achieving a size which allows the combined company
to compete effectively for expansion opportunities anywhere in the world while
continuing to build upon the existing footprint of both companies.  The
expanded operational capability of a more diversified company will produce
significant benefits for our customers and provide substantial growth
opportunities for our people.  In addition, the cash consideration allows us
to provide each companies' shareholders with a meaningful financial return
without unduly limiting the growth potential for the combined entity.  This is
an ideal fit for the stakeholders in both companies.""

    Following the merger, in addition to the executive officers listed above,
Bob Proffit, current Senior Vice President, Human Resources of Grey Wolf, will
assume the role of Senior Vice President, Administration at the combined
company and Spencer Armour, current Senior Vice President, Corporate
Development of Basic Energy Services, will remain in the same role at the
combined company.  Operating level officers for both companies will continue
in their current roles.

Completion of the transaction is subject to shareholder approval at both Grey
Wolf and Basic Energy Services, receipt of financing proceeds, regulatory

Chaparral to become a publicly traded company

Companies to conduct investor conference call on Wednesday, October 14 at
11:00 a.m. ET

  PR Newswire

  OKLAHOMA CITY and NEW YORK, Oct. 12

OKLAHOMA CITY and NEW YORK, Oct. 12 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ --Chaparral Energy,
Inc. (""Chaparral"" or ""the Company""), a privately-owned SEC reporting,
independent oil and gas exploration and production company, and United
Refining Energy Corp. (""URX""), a publicly held special purpose acquisition
company (NYSE Amex: Units: URX.U, Common Stock: URX, Warrants: URX.WS) jointly
announced today that they have entered into an agreement through which
Chaparral and URX will merge. The proposed transaction is expected to close no
later than December 11, 2009. The combined company will be named Chaparral
Energy, Inc. and will continue to trade on the NYSE Amex until approval of a
planned application to transfer listing to the NYSE, where the symbol ""CPR""
has been reserved. The proposed transaction is valued at approximately $1.8
billion.

URX is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) formed in December 2007
for the purpose of acquiring through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset
acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination
with one or more businesses or assets in the energy industry. It has
approximately $452 million in trust as of September 30, 2009.

Since its founding in 1988, Chaparral has developed a substantial asset base
of long-lived oil and gas properties, with a large inventory of low-risk
exploitation opportunities, as well as near-term, high-potential drilling
projects. As of June 30, 2009, Chaparral's proved reserves were 146 million
barrels of oil equivalent, 62% of which is oil, and its average daily
production for the first half of 2009 was 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
day. Since 2003, management has increased Chaparral's reserves and production
by approximately 21% per year.

Chaparral has achieved this growth primarily by acquiring and enhancing
properties in its core areas of the Mid-Continent and the Permian Basin, as
well as in the Gulf Coast, the Ark-La-Tex region, North Texas and the Rocky
Mountains. The Company plans to continue to pursue a growth strategy through a
mix of development drilling, acquisitions, operating improvements, enhanced
oil recovery projects (EOR) and select exploration projects.

Chaparral strives to control its operating costs and minimizes commodity price
risk through a hedging program. Chaparral has several EOR projects under way
using CO2 injection and has identified candidates for EOR development from its
portfolio of properties, thereby offering the potential for substantial
reserve and production growth.

The senior management of Chaparral, including Mark A. Fischer, its Co-founder,
Chairman and CEO; Joseph O. Evans, CFO; and Robert W. Kelly II, Senior Vice
President and General Counsel, will continue to lead Chaparral. John A.
Catsimatidis, URX's current CEO and Chairman, will become Executive Chairman
of the Board of Directors of the combined company.

""I believe the proposed merger with Chaparral is a great deal for URX
shareholders. We have spent almost two years looking for the right target for
our SPAC, and I believe this is the best opportunity that we have considered.
Chaparral's management team has demonstrated the ability to find lucrative oil
and gas properties at prices that have resulted in superior returns on
investment. With the additional capital provided by the proposed merger, I
believe Chaparral will be even more successful. I am pleased to present this
business opportunity to the URX shareholders for approval.""

""This merger with URX will allow us to achieve our strategic goal of becoming
a publicly traded company on one of the major stock exchanges,"" said Fischer.
""This merger will give Chaparral access to capital we need to exploit our
large inventory of drilling and development opportunities and to significantly
step up our EOR program.""

Chaparral expects 2009 production to be approximately 7.6 million barrels of
oil equivalent and 2010 production to be approximately 9.9 million barrels of
oil equivalent, a 30% increase over 2009. The 2010 estimates were prepared on
a well-specific basis and based on capital expenditures of approximately $410
million. At current strip prices, Chaparral's 2010 EBITDA estimate would be
approximately $335 million. Its 2010 capital expenditures will be funded
through discretionary cash flow, anticipated to be around $250 million, and
additional liquidity provided by the combination with URX. Assuming a combined
company stock price of approximately $10 per share, total enterprise value
would be $1.8 billion, implying a multiple of 2010 estimated EBITDA of 5.3x.

Terms of the Proposed Transaction

Upon closing of the proposed transaction, Chaparral shareholders will exchange
their entire equity stake in Chaparral for 58 million shares in the combined
company. They will also be entitled to 20 million additional contingent
shares, 5 million of which will be issued but subject to forfeiture. The
contingent shares include 15 million shares that will be earned if the
combined company achieves certain specific stock price targets, representing
approximately 25% annual share price growth within a three-year period and 5
million shares that will be earned if the combined company achieves an EBITDA
target of $600 million within a five-year period. Upon closing of the proposed
transaction, shares held by the URX Sponsor will be restructured into 5.6
million shares in the combined company and 5.6 million contingent shares
subject to forfeiture under the same terms as the Chaparral contingent shares.

Assuming 24% of the URX public shareholders elect to redeem their shares for
cash, and 50% of the URX warrants are redeemed for cash at $0.50 per warrant,
upon closing of the proposed transaction Chaparral will receive approximately
$300 million in cash. The cash will be used to reduce the amount outstanding
under Chaparral's revolving senior secured credit facility, as well as for
working capital and general corporate purposes. Pro forma for the proposed
transaction, Chaparral will have total debt to projected 2010 EBITDA ratio of
2.6x and total debt to proved reserves ratio of $6.02 per barrel of oil
equivalent (using June 30, 2009 reserve estimates). Based on these
assumptions, at closing the combined company will have a total of
approximately 98 million shares outstanding, excluding all contingent shares
and warrants. Chaparral shareholders will own 59% of the combined company, URX
shareholders will own 35% and the URX Sponsor will own 6%.

Consummation of the proposed transaction is subject to URX shareholder
approval, URX warrantholder approval of a proposed warrantholder amendment,
the refinancing of Chaparral's existing revolving senior secured credit
facility, receipt of a minimum of $250 million of cash from URX upon closing,
(taking into account the redemption rate and the proposed transaction related
expenses), and other customary closing conditions.

URX will file a proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission in connection with a special meeting of its stockholders to seek
approval for the proposed transaction, as well as certain other matters in
connection with the proposed transaction. The proxy statement will also be
mailed to warrantholders of URX in connection with a special meeting of its
warrantholders to seek approval of an amendment to the Warrant Agreement which
governs the terms of the warrants.

Additional information regarding URX, Chaparral, the proposed transaction and
related matters will be available on a Form 8-K to be filed by URX and a Form
8-K to be filed by Chaparral. Copies can be obtained without charge at the
Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

Forward-Looking Statements

This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding URX,
Chaparral and URX's business after completion of the proposed transactions.
Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. Such
forward-looking statements, which are based upon the current beliefs and
expectations of the management of URX and Chaparral, are subject to risks and
uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from the
forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause
actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking
statements: the Company's ability to complete its initial business combination
within the specified time limits; officers and directors allocating their time
to other businesses or potentially having conflicts of interest with the
Company's business or in approving the proposed transaction; success in
retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, the Company's officers, key
employees or directors following the proposed transaction; the Company's
revenues and operating performance; changes in overall economic conditions;
anticipated business development activities of the Company following the
proposed transaction, general economic conditions, as well as other relevant
risks detailed in URX's and Chaparral's filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The information set forth herein should be read in light
of such risks. Neither URX nor Chaparral assumes any obligation to update the
information contained in this release.

Non-GAAP Information

This release makes reference to EBITDA which is defined as earnings before
interest; taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is not a measure of
financial performance recognized by accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States, or GAAP. Our management uses this non-GAAP measure in
its analysis of performance and believes the presentation of EBITDA provides
useful information regarding our ability to service debt and fund capital
expenditures, and to help our investors understand our operating performance
and make it easier to compare our results with those of other companies that
have different financing, capital and tax structures. EBITDA should not be
considered in isolation from or as a substitute for net income, as an
indication of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities or
as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA as we calculate it may not be comparable to
EBITDA measures reported by other companies. In addition, EBITDA does not
represent funds available for discretionary use.

securities. URX, Chaparral and their respective directors and officers may be
deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies for the special

    FULLERTON, Calif. and SAN DIEGO, March 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ --
Beckman Coulter, Inc. (NYSE: BEC), a leading developer, manufacturer, and
marketer of products that simplify, automate, and innovate complex biomedical
tests, and Biosite(R) Incorporated (Nasdaq: BSTE), a leading biomedical
company commercializing proteomics discoveries for the advancement of medical
diagnosis, announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger
agreement under which Beckman Coulter will acquire all of Biosite's
outstanding common stock in a cash tender offer of $85.00 per share, or
approximately $1.55 billion on a fully diluted share basis. The proposed
transaction is expected to immediately accelerate Beckman Coulter's revenue
growth, improve operating margins and be accretive to GAAP earnings in 2008
and beyond.

    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20031202/BECLOGO )

    Scott Garrett, Beckman Coulter's President and Chief Executive Officer,
said, ""This is an exciting transaction that grew out of our successful
relationship with Biosite over the past four years in the area of B-type
Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), a test that aids in the diagnosis, risk
stratification and assessment of severity of heart failure and the risk
stratification of patients with acute coronary syndromes. It will position
Beckman Coulter as a leading provider of immunoassay tests, especially within
cardiac diagnostics.  Biosite utilizes third-party distributors, and more than
85% of sales come from within the United States.  A major source of value in
the transaction is our ability to leverage our global commercial
infrastructure and installed base to expand sales of Biosite's immunoassay
tests, including BNP.  Longer term, we will have significant opportunities to
leverage Biosite's pipeline of novel diagnostic tests across our large
installed base of automated systems in hospital laboratories.  Additionally,
the transaction will expand our offerings into near-patient testing, providing
additional markets for many of our highest-value tests.""

    Biosite's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Kim Blickenstaff, stated,
""We have enjoyed a close relationship with Beckman Coulter, and together we
can enhance our delivery of high value diagnostic solutions that improve
clinical and economic outcomes for acute diseases.  Our focus is clearly
aligned with Beckman Coulter's dedication to improving patient health and
reducing the cost of care.  Beckman Coulter's reputation and global
infrastructure will be instrumental in expanding the market opportunity for
our Triage(R) family of diagnostic products around the world.  Our board of
directors believes that this transaction is in the best interest of our
shareholders, employees and other stakeholders and has unanimously voted to
recommend that Biosite shareholders tender their shares in this offer.""

    Scott Garrett added, ""We expect the transaction to be accretive to GAAP
earnings in 2008, and we remain on track to achieve our full year 2007
outlook, as stated in our February 8 earnings release, excluding any impact
from the Biosite acquisition. We expect significant revenue growth resulting
from the improved effectiveness of our global commercial franchise selling BNP
along with other cardiac markers.   Biosite will bring to Beckman Coulter an
entrepreneurial culture and talented workforce recognized for product and
market development.  Everyone at Beckman Coulter looks forward to expanding
our collaboration with the Biosite team in San Diego and elsewhere, as we
maintain and grow the center of excellence that Biosite has established.""

    Beckman Coulter will promptly commence a tender offer for all of Biosite's
outstanding common stock.  The offer is conditioned upon at least a majority
of the outstanding Biosite shares, determined on a fully diluted basis, being
tendered, as well as the satisfaction of regulatory and other customary
conditions.  Approval of the transaction by Beckman Coulter's shareholders is
not required.  It is currently expected that the transaction will close in the
second quarter of 2007.

connection with the acquisition and is serving as dealer manager for the
proposed tender offer.   Goldman Sachs is acting as financial advisor to

   Stewart Enterprises Rejects Proposal From Service Corporation
                           International
*T
JEFFERSON, La., July 14, 2008 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Stewart Enterprises,
Inc. (Nasdaq:STEI) has rejected a proposal from Service Corporation
International to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Stewart for
$9.50 in cash. In a letter dated June 25, 2008, SCI invited Stewart
Enterprises to enter into negotiations regarding the possible
combination of the two companies. In the letter, SCI stated that were
it to be given access to certain non-public,
non-competitively-sensitive information about Stewart's overhead and
trust management structure, it might be able to improve its offer,
suggesting a potential range of $10.25 to $11.25 per share.

Stewart's Board of Directors carefully evaluated the terms of the
proposal and unanimously concluded that it is in the best interests of
Stewart Enterprises and its shareholders to reject the proposal as
inadequate. The Board believes that the company is accomplishing
positive change with its new management team, and is committed to
implementing the company's previously disclosed long-term strategic
plan, including its Best in Class, Innovation and Acquisition
initiatives. Stewart's response was communicated in a letter to SCI
dated July 7, 2008.

Chairman of the Board Frank B. Stewart, Jr., has advised Stewart
Enterprises' Board that, subsequent to the company's July 7 response to
SCI, he communicated directly to SCI's President and Chief Executive
Officer Thomas L. Ryan his view that the proposal was inadequate and
that the timing was not right for discussions. He advised Mr. Ryan of
his belief that currently the best course for the company and its
shareholders to increase shareholder value is for the company to pursue
its business plan independently under its new senior management.

SCI disclosed the two letters in a Form 8-K filed this morning. In its
Form 8-K, SCI stated, among other things, that it ""intends to honor the
decision of the Board of Directors of Stewart.""

Founded in 1910, Stewart Enterprises is the second largest provider of
products and services in the death care industry in the United States.
The Company currently owns and operates 221 funeral homes and 139
cemeteries in the United States and Puerto Rico. Through its
subsidiaries, the Company provides a complete range of funeral
merchandise and services, along with cemetery property, merchandise and

    ""This is a compelling strategic transaction that affords exciting
opportunities to our shareholders, business partners and employees,"" said Alan
H. Cohen, Chief Executive Officer of The Finish Line.  ""With Genesco, we will
enhance our strength in athletics and gain an immediate presence in new and
growing retail categories to further diversify our business and deepen our
vendor relationships.  We believe the increased scale achieved through our
combination will better enable us to drive strong returns in this competitive
retail environment.

    ""We have great admiration for the Genesco team and their proven record of
identifying and capitalizing on new consumer trends.  Their long-term success
in operating under different retail banners and their industry-leading
merchandising strategies will strongly complement our own initiatives,""
continued Mr. Cohen.  ""The Finish Line and Genesco share a heritage of
superior service, dedication to employees and a culture of creativity.
Through this combination, we ensure that these characteristics that have long
distinguished our companies will continue.  We welcome Genesco's management
and employees to The Finish Line and are confident that they will be an
important part of the combined company's success.""

    ""Following a review of our strategic alternatives, we believe that this
combination is in the best interests of our shareholders.  We have long
admired The Finish Line's entrepreneurial spirit, and believe that together we
will be able to leverage the combined companies' scale and talents,"" said
Genesco's Chief Executive Officer, Hal N. Pennington.  ""In addition, Genesco
and The Finish Line share similar philosophies that promote a strong team
culture and the spirit of creativity.  These value systems, which have long
distinguished our companies, will continue to define the next chapter of our
history together.""


    Benefits of the Transaction

     - Increased Scale.  On a pro forma basis, the combined company had
       revenues of approximately $2.8 billion, based on the twelve months
       trailing as of May 31, 2007.  In addition, The Finish Line will have
       expanded platforms for future growth with 2,870 retail stores
       throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.

     - New Growth Opportunities.  Already a leader in athletic footwear and
       apparel with its Finish Line stores, the transaction adds growing
       retail concepts to The Finish Line's portfolio.  These include
       Journeys, which offers the most trend-relevant footwear and accessories
       for young adults, Hat World, the leading mall-based retailer of the
       latest team and fashion headwear, and Johnston and Murphy, the premier
       lifestyle brand for men.  The Finish Line will also gain a presence in
       the growing branded and licensed wholesale business, as well as the
       recently launched concepts of Shi by Journeys and Lids Kids.

     - Broad Portfolio of Retail Businesses.  As a result of the combined
       company's multiple retail concepts and more extensive product offerings
       across footwear and apparel categories, The Finish Line will be able to
       satisfy a wider spectrum of consumers and their needs.

     - Cost Savings and Operational Efficiencies.  The transaction is expected
       to generate approximately $15 million to $20 million in annual cost
       savings beginning in the first full year of operations, including
       integration costs, from shared administrative services, increased scale
       in purchasing, marketing and advertising, and sourcing and logistics
       efficiencies.  This transaction is about growth, and The Finish Line
       does not expect significant changes to the workforce.


    Financing

    The Finish Line expects the transaction to be funded through a combination
of approximately $11 million in cash on hand and up to $1.6 billion in
financing pursuant to a commitment provided by UBS Securities LLC, consisting
of a Revolving Credit Facility, a Senior Secured Term Loan and a Senior Bridge
Facility.  Following the transaction, The Finish Line believes its strong cash
flow from operations will allow it to reduce its net debt and fully fund its
growth initiatives.


    Headquarters

    Upon the close of the transaction, Genesco will become a subsidiary of The
Finish Line.  The Company will be headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana and
will maintain Genesco's operations in Nashville, Tennessee.

Business Wire

HOUSTON -- August 13, 2010

Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN) today announced that it has entered into a definitive
merger agreement pursuant to which it will be acquired by an affiliate of The
Blackstone Group L.P. (NYSE:BX) in a transaction valued at approximately $4.7
billion, including the assumption of existing debt.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Dynegy stockholders will receive
$4.50 in cash for each outstanding share of Dynegy common stock they own,
which represents a 62 percent premium to the closing share price on August 12,
2010.

Dynegys Board of Directors believes the proposed transaction with Blackstone
provides our stockholders with a significant premium over the current stock
price and removes the risks to the existing stockholders associated with
volatile commodity prices, challenging capital markets and environmental and
regulatory uncertainties, said Bruce A. Williamson, Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer of Dynegy Inc. Blackstone is a world-class firm with
substantial resources and investment experience in the power generation
business, and we believe they are well positioned to lead Dynegy going forward
as a private company.

We share Dynegys commitment to safety, operational reliability and
environmental responsibility, said David Foley, Senior Managing Director of
Blackstone. We look forward to working together with Dynegys employees to
realize the full potential of the companys attractive portfolio of power
generation assets.

After careful analysis, Dynegys Board of Directors has approved the merger
agreement and recommended that Dynegys stockholders adopt the merger
agreement with an affiliate of Blackstone. A special meeting of Dynegys
stockholders will be held following the preparation and filing of a proxy
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission and a subsequent mailing
to stockholders. The company will use its reasonable best efforts to file a
preliminary proxy statement related to the merger within 15 business days
after the date of the merger agreement, and it is currently anticipated that
the stockholder meeting will be held in the fourth quarter 2010.

Under the merger agreement, Dynegy is permitted to solicit alternative
proposals from third parties for a period of 40 days after the date of the
merger agreement. There can be no assurance that the solicitation of
alternative proposals will result in Dynegy receiving a superior proposal from
a third party.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2010. Completion of the
transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by
Dynegy stockholders and receipt of regulatory approvals. The transaction is
not subject to any financing conditions, and a fund managed by Blackstone has
committed to contribute all of the equity necessary to complete the
transaction.

In addition to the transaction discussed in this news release, Blackstone and
NRG Energy have entered into a separate and exclusive agreement through which
NRG Energy will acquire four natural gas-fired assets currently owned by
Dynegy  the Casco Bay facility in Maine and the Moss Landing, Morro Bay and
Oakland facilities in California  for cash consideration of approximately
$1.36 billion. The consummation of the merger transaction between Dynegy and
Blackstone is contingent upon the concurrent closing of the Blackstone and NRG
Energy transaction.

Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Greenhill & Co., LLC acted as financial advisors to
Dynegy and provided Dynegys Board of Directors with fairness opinions related
to the transaction. Sullivan & Cromwell LLP acted as legal counsel to Dynegy.
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Blackstone Advisory Partners acted as
financial advisors to Blackstone. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP acted as
legal counsel to Blackstone.

ArcelorMittal Announces Sale of Sparrows Point

Luxembourg/Rotterdam, August 2, 2007 - The world's leading steel
manufacturer, ArcelorMittal, announces today that ArcelorMittal
USA has entered into an agreement to sell its Sparrows Point
facility and related railroad, intellectual property and other
assets for an undisclosed purchase price to a joint venture
entity sponsored by Esmark Incorporated and Wheeling-Pittsburgh
Corporation, with participation by industry and institutional
investors.

Located near Baltimore, MD, Sparrows Point is a former Bethlehem
Steel plant that is a fully integrated steel-making facility
capable of producing 3.9 million tons of raw steel annually.
Products made at Sparrows Point include hot-rolled sheets, cold-
rolled sheet, galvanized sheet, Galvalume?, tin mill products and
semi-finished steel. Markets served include construction, steel
service centers, automotive, container and appliance.

?We have been working closely with the Department of Justice for
several months to satisfy the terms of the consent decree and are
pleased that this process has reached its conclusion?, Aditya
Mittal, ArcelorMittal's CFO and head of Flat Carbon Americas,
commented.

?Sparrows Point has been an important part of ArcelorMittal USA
and I know the facility will continue to thrive under new
ownership,? commented Michael G. Rippey, President & CEO of
ArcelorMittal USA. ?We greatly respect the uncertainty that the
more than 3,000 employees at Sparrows Point have had to live with
during this difficult period and we thank them for their service
to our company, while wishing them the best of luck in the
future.?

Following the bid of Mittal Steel Company N.V. (?Mittal?) for
Arcelor S.A., Mittal agreed with the United States Department of
Justice (DOJ) to divest the Sparrows Point Business. The sale of
the Sparrows Point Business remains subject to DOJ approval and
customary closing conditions. The sale is expected to close in
the fall of this year. Once the transaction is approved,
ArcelorMittal willl disclose all outstanding details related to
it.

By Yee Kai Pin
     Feb. 4 (Bloomberg) -- KNM Group Bhd., a Malaysian oil and
gas services provider, said it received a takeover proposal from
a company controlled by its founder and group managing director,
Lee Swee Eng.
     The proposal, made in collaboration with GS Capital
Partners VI Fund LP and Mettiz Capital Ltd., is equivalent to 90
sen (0.26 cent) a share, KNM said in a statement. Thats 20
percent more than KNMs closing price today, according to
Bloomberg calculations.
     KNM, which makes processing equipment for the oil and gas,
petrochemical and mineral industries, has a market valuation of
about 3 billion ringgit. The stock has risen 70 percent over the
past 12 months. Lee holds 1.13 percent of the companys shares,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
     The offer is fair, said Wong Chin Wai, an analyst at
RHB Capital Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur, who maintained his
outperform recommendation on the company. But Lee is going
to have to borrow definitely, Wong said by phone.
     BlueFire Capital Group Ltd., the company controlled by Lee
that made the bid, has until March 22 to complete due diligence,
including the receipt of firm financing commitments, the
statement said.
     KNM closed in Kuala Lumpur trading at 75 sen, unchanged
from yesterday. Of the 15 analysts who track the company, eight
have buy calls, five have hold recommendations, and two
say sell, according to Bloomberg data.
     Lee was the founder and group managing director of the
company since its inception, according to the KNM Web site.

last trading day prior to announcement of the transaction. Holders of
the Company's Class A, Class B and Class C Common Stock will each
receive the same price per share.

   The board of directors of Cumulus, on the unanimous recommendation
of a special committee comprised of all of the disinterested members
of the board of directors, has approved the merger agreement and
recommends that the Company's stockholders approve the merger.

   ""I am extremely pleased to be partnering with Merrill Lynch Global
Private Equity in this transaction,"" said Lew Dickey, who will
continue as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company after the merger. ""This transaction represents an important
chapter in our Company's history. We strongly believe in this industry
and in the long-term opportunities to grow the business. I look
forward to working closely with our talented team and our new partners
to build upon our success.""

   Pending the receipt of stockholder approval, expiration of the
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976 and approval of the Federal Communications Commission, as well
as satisfaction of other closing conditions, the transaction currently
is expected to be completed in early 2008. The transaction will be
financed through a combination of equity contributed by Lew Dickey,
his brother John W. Dickey, the Company's Executive Vice President and
Co-Chief Operating Officer, other members of their family and Merrill
Lynch Global Private Equity, and debt financing that has been
committed by Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, in each case subject
to customary conditions. There is no financing condition to the
obligations of the investor group under the merger agreement.

   The Dickeys and stockholders affiliated with Banc of America
Capital Investors, each under separate voting agreements, have
contractually agreed to vote their shares of Cumulus common stock in
favor of the transaction or any superior proposal approved by the
Cumulus board of directors, as provided in the merger agreement.

   Under the merger agreement, Cumulus may solicit superior proposals
from third parties during the next 45 days. In accordance with the
agreement, the board of directors of Cumulus, through its special
committee and with the assistance of its independent advisors, intends
to actively solicit superior proposals during this period. Cumulus
advises that there can be no assurance, however, that the solicitation
of superior proposals will result in an alternative transaction.
Cumulus currently does not intend to disclose publicly developments
with respect to the solicitation process unless and until its board of
directors has made a decision to pursue such a superior proposal.

the depth and scale to prosper in the high growth video content creation,

       NOK 16 in ARRIS shares and at least NOK 80 in cash for each TANDBERG
       Television share held.

    Transaction Benefits

    Combining the resources and experience of ARRIS and TANDBERG Television
will produce a new company, unique in its ability to enable voice, video and
data over any network and to any device. ARRIS is a leading global provider of
VoIP, data broadband network equipment and consumer premises devices; TANDBERG
Television is a market leader in both the digital video sector and the global
video processing market with award-winning solutions for advanced compression,
on-demand and interactive television.

    ARRIS and TANDBERG Television have a strong shared philosophy of
innovation and track-records of profitable growth. The new company will have a
significant global presence with over 1600 employees and 2000+ customers in
more than 100 countries. ARRIS' strong North American cable business and
strategic customers in key international markets will be significantly
expanded through TANDBERG Television's international market leadership
position in IPTV, HDTV and on-demand television.

    ""The combination of ARRIS and TANDBERG Television is positive for the
digital media industry and a truly exceptional opportunity for both
companies,"" said Bob Stanzione, Chairman & CEO of ARRIS. ""By bringing together
these two market leaders we are able to expand on our vision to be the global
leader in the provision of digital IP infrastructure and to enable voice,
video and data to be delivered over integrated broadband networks from the
content provider to the head-end to the home. With this merger, we are
creating a new force, with best-in-class technologies and an outstanding team
of people with a unique understanding of all service provider networks, the
technologies that enable them, and the content that travels through them.""

    Stanzione continued, ""The transaction further enhances our growth
opportunities by adding several products to our portfolio that enable us to
address the global telecom, satellite, and broadcast video markets that have
historically been TANDBERG Television's largest customers. These markets are
expected to grow rapidly, allowing ARRIS to capture significant capital
spending in these markets. We will give the existing TANDBERG Television team
the support they need to continue to satisfy and earn the loyalty of their
current and potential customers. In addition, we see many opportunities in
leveraging the great engineering resources from both companies to meet the
evolving technology needs of our customers worldwide.""

    ""Our customers are increasingly relying on next generation technologies to
help them create and distribute converged and differentiated voice, data and
video services,"" said Eric Cooney, CEO of TANDBERG Television. ""There is a
clear benefit in being able to source these solutions from one trusted partner.
The combination of ARRIS and TANDBERG Television is ideally placed to provide
the technologies, the knowledge and the systems delivery and integration
expertise that our customers around the world can rely on to build profitable
digital businesses.""

    After diligent, thorough review, the Board of Directors of TANDBERG
Television has unanimously recommended that the shareholders accept the ARRIS
offer.  ""The on-going industry consolidation amongst our key customer base
creates a demand for companies that can offer an increasing scale and scope of
supply on a global basis.  The combination of ARRIS and TANDBERG Television
clearly creates that market leading supplier of voice, video and data
solutions,"" said Jan Christian Opsahl, Chairman of TANDBERG Television.

    ""The terms of the transaction are very positive for the continued
financial growth of our Company,"" said David Potts, ARRIS EVP & CFO.  ""We
anticipate that the transaction will improve our overall gross margin and is
expected to be accretive in 2008, excluding amortization of intangibles and
non-cash equity compensation expense."" Attached to the press release is a
summary of each company's financial profile.

    TANDBERG Television reports its results under International Financial
Reporting Standards (""IFRS"").  ARRIS reports its results under US GAAP. There
are a number of differences between IFRS and US GAAP accounting standards.
Historical and pro forma financial information for TANDBERG Television or the
combined companies on a US GAAP basis are not presently available but will be
reconciled and provided on a Form 8-K filed by ARRIS following the successful
completion of the transaction. ARRIS and TANDBERG Television anticipate that
such reconciliation will result in both revenues and expenses for TANDBERG
Television being recognized in different periods than reported under IFRS.
Under certain circumstances, TANDBERG Television revenues and costs recognized
under IFRS, but deferred in the US GAAP reconciliation, will not be recognized
in future periods as a result of customary purchase accounting.  These non-
cash US GAAP reconciling adjustments and the non-cash purchase accounting
adjustments could be substantial.


    Conditions to the Offer
     - Receipt of valid and unconditional acceptances for more than 90% of
       TANDBERG Television's shares.
     - No change in the share capital or number of shares, no dividend, and no
       issuance of any instrument giving shareholders the right to call shares
       on the part of TANDBERG Television.
     - Completion of all necessary governmental and regulatory approvals on
       terms acceptable to ARRIS.
     - No material adverse change and no legislation, regulation, decision of
       any court or public authority, or other measures including third party
       actions, beyond ARRIS' control that would prevent the acquisition.
     - Compliance by TANDBERG with the covenants included in the Transaction
       Agreement.

    STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Cenveo, Inc.
(NYSE: CVO) today announced that it sent the following letter to Banta
Corporation (NYSE: BN):


    October 19, 2006

    Ms. Stephanie A. Streeter
    Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
    Banta Corporation
    225 Main Street
    Menasha, WI  54952-2003

    Dear Ms. Streeter:


    It has been more than two weeks since we submitted our proposal to acquire
Banta for $50 per share (or $34 per share if the acquisition is completed
after the record date for your ""special"" dividend).  In twelve days, on
October 31, 2006, our proposal to acquire Banta will expire.  I do not plan to
blink and increase our proposal.

    The only reason I can think of for your delay in responding to our
proposal is that your advisors are still looking for another party to pay a
higher price.  The fact of the matter is that Banta has had over two months to
determine whether any third parties will pay more than Cenveo.  As you know,
the potential list of parties willing to purchase Banta is extremely limited.
Cenveo will not be a back-stop bidder to any other persons who may propose to
acquire Banta.

    I have already spelled out all the reasons why these two companies should
be together.  We believe that the Banta/Cenveo printing platform would be a
major success and clearly in the best interest of both companies'
shareholders.  As CEOs, we make many decisions every single day.  In our
business career we will make one or two decisions that actually change the
direction of our company and impact all of our employees.  During these
critical times when major decisions are made, I always remember an old quote
""The world hates change, yet it is the only thing that has brought progress.""

    We hope that you accept our proposal.  As always, we are willing and ready
to meet with you to discuss any questions you might have.  Thank you.


    Sincerely,

    CENVEO, INC.

uncertain return to consistent profitability; (7) the absence of long-term
customer agreements in our industry, subjecting our business to fluctuations;
(8) factors affecting the U.S. postal services; (9) increases in paper costs

    - Company Poised to Benefit from Supply / Demand Imbalances in
                           Power Industry -


HOUSTON & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 12, 2008
Complete Energy Holdings, LLC (""Complete Energy"" or the ""Company"")
and GSC Acquisition Company (""GSCAC"") (AMEX: GGA) announced today that
they have signed a definitive agreement to merge GSCAC with Complete
Energy, an independent power producer. GSCAC is a special purpose
acquisition company that went public in June, 2007. The transaction
values the Company at $1.3 billion and among other things will provide
Complete Energy with access to the public capital markets.

   Complete Energy owns and operates two natural gas-fired combined
cycle power generation facilities. The 1,022 MW La Paloma generating
facility (""La Paloma""), located 110 miles northwest of Los Angeles,
serves energy-constrained California. The 837 MW Batesville generating
facility (""Batesville""), located in northern Mississippi, serves the
Southeast region of the U.S. The transaction values the La Paloma
plant at $900 million ($881 per kW) and the Batesville plant at $400
million ($478 per kW) on a cash-free, debt-free basis.

   ""This is an exciting time to invest in the power industry. We
expect strong growth in demand for electricity in the U.S., combined
with the lack of significant investment in generation in recent years,
to create opportunities for increased value,"" said Hugh Tarpley,
co-founder of Complete Energy who will continue to lead the company as
CEO. ""Our assets are strategically located, highly efficient and have
the potential for expansion.""

   ""As part of a public company, Complete Energy will have access to
capital that will enable us to accelerate our growth strategy by
pursuing acquisitions and expansion opportunities. We are pleased to
be partnering with GSCAC, a group of experienced investment
professionals with a proven track record, and to have the continued
support of The TCW Group (""TCW""), which will remain a significant
investor in our company,"" said Tarpley.

   ""Complete Energy has strong and stable cash flow and a high
quality management team,"" said Matthew Kaufman, president of GSCAC.
""Furthermore, this deal has the characteristics we believe are
essential for a successful SPAC transaction: a company that will
benefit from access to public capital as an engine for growth; an
all-equity deal that aligns the interests of management and other
current Complete Energy owners and stakeholders with those of GSCAC's
shareholders; and a compelling opportunity to own a focused asset play
in the independent power producer sector, which is poised for
significant growth.""

   ""We were impressed with the quality of the Complete Energy power
generation assets and are excited about the current market dynamics in
both California and the Southeast, as well as the significant
opportunity that this portfolio provides for both brownfield expansion
and acquisitions,"" said Kaufman.

   Under the terms of the transaction agreements, GSCAC is expected
to issue approximately $440 million of new equity to Complete Energy's
current owners and to other holders of debt and equity of Complete
Energy subsidiaries, assume approximately $627 million of net
project-level debt, and retire other debt and pay transaction expenses
of approximately $183 million, and a GSCAC subsidiary will also issue
a $50 million mezzanine note. The terms also provide for the issuance
of five million additional GSCAC shares to the current owners and
stakeholders of Complete Energy and its subsidiaries if GSCAC's stock
price reaches $14.50, and five million additional shares if GSCAC's
stock price reaches $15.50 per share within five years; Complete
Energy management will receive approximately 36% of these contingent
shares.

   As a result of these transactions, investment funds affiliated
with TCW are expected to become GSCAC's largest shareholders, with
approximately 19% ownership; GSCAC's existing shareholders are
expected to collectively own approximately 42% of GSCAC; and the
current owners of Complete Energy are expected to own approximately
10% of GSCAC, in each case on a fully-diluted basis and assuming that
all of the current minority interest owners in Complete Energy's
subsidiaries participate in the transaction.

   Post merger, Complete Energy will continue to be led by Hugh
Tarpley and Lori Cuervo, industry veterans and founders of the
Company. Tarpley and Cuervo have more than 45 combined years of
experience managing and growing large power generation companies.
Cuervo will serve as the Company's president and chief operating
officer.

   The transaction is subject to a shareholder vote which requires
that a majority of GSCAC's public stockholders, attending the meeting
in person or by proxy, vote in favor of the transaction and not more
than 20% of the shares (minus one share) held by public stockholders
vote against the transaction and exercise their rights to have their
shares converted into cash. The transaction is also subject to other
customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.

   La Paloma Generating Facility

   La Paloma is a 1,022 MW gas-fired, four-unit combined-cycle
facility located near Bakersfield, California, approximately 110 miles
northwest of Los Angeles. The facility is one of the most efficient
fossil-fired generation assets in California and is geographically
positioned to serve both northern and southern California. Key growth
factors include:

   --  Generation supply is lagging strong demand growth in
        California, which is near minimum required reserve margins due
        to strong load growth and limited new build activity.

   --  Power revenues must increase substantially in order to
        stimulate the construction of new generating assets.

   --  Long lead time (3-5 years) for development is likely to keep
        the region constrained for the foreseeable future.

   Batesville Generating Facility

   Batesville is an 837 MW gas-fired, three-unit combined cycle
facility located in northern Mississippi, 60 miles south of Memphis,
Tennessee. Batesville is strategically located within the growing
Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (""SERC"") region with
transmission interconnections with Entergy Corporation and the
Tennessee Valley Authority. All of the facility's output is currently
sold under long-term power purchase agreements with J. Aron & Company
and the South Mississippi Electric Power Association, providing
long-term and visible future cash flows. Key growth factors include:

   --  Improving supply/demand balance supported by load growth as a
        result of above-average population and economic growth in the
        southeastern U.S.

   --  SERC is dominated by aging coal-fired generation nearing
        design life limits and exposed to potential carbon
        legislation.

   --  Attractive long-term contracts provide strong and stable cash
        flows.

   Additional information about the transaction as well as Complete
Energy's operations and historical financial information will be
contained in an investor presentation that will be made public and
filed by GSCAC with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.

   Conference Call

   Complete Energy and GSCAC will host a conference call on Monday,
May 12, 2008 at 10 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) to discuss the transaction.
The call will be open to the public. All interested parties should

By Tim Culpan
     April 6 (Bloomberg) -- KKR & Co. and Yageo Corp.s chief
executive officer offered to buy out the Taiwanese maker of
electronic components, valuing the company at NT$47 billion
($1.6 billion).
     Orion Investment Co., a newly formed company owned by Yageo
CEO Pierre Chen and funds managed by KKR, offered NT$16.10 in
cash for each share of the Taiwanese company, Orion said in an
e-mailed statement today. The shares surged by their daily limit
after the bid was 14 percent higher than the stocks last
closing price in Taipei.
     The purchase would allow Chen and KKR, which currently own
the equivalent of 34 percent of Yageo, to take control of the
components maker at a time when electronics producers are
searching for alternative suppliers in the wake of last months
earthquake and tsunami in Japan that crippled scores of
factories. Yageo makes products ranging from ceramic capacitors
to ferrites and inductors used in electronics.
     Yageo climbed 6.7 percent to NT$15.05 as of 9:12 a.m. in
Taipei. UBS AG advised Orion.

  PR Newswire

  DUBLIN, June 16, 2011

DUBLIN, June 16, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Cooper Industries plc (NYSE: CBE)
(""Cooper"") today announces that on 1 June it made a proposal to the Board of
Laird plc (""Laird"") to acquire Laird by way of a cash offer at 185 pence per
Laird share, a 35% premium to yesterday's closing price.  This proposal is
subject only to limited pre-conditions.  Cooper believes there is a strong
rationale for this transaction and that an all cash offer at this level would
provide Laird shareholders with an attractive premium combined with the
certainty of cash value now.

(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20101214/MM17721LOGO )

The Board of Laird has rejected this proposal.  Cooper is disappointed that
despite its efforts to enter into a constructive dialogue with Laird on
several occasions, the Laird Board has stated that it is currently unwilling
to engage with Cooper.  Cooper's strong preference remains to work towards a
recommended transaction through a constructive dialogue with the Laird Board.
 

Cooper is proposing an all cash offer of 185 pence per Laird share, to be made
by Cooper Industries Holdings (Ireland) Limited (""Holdings""), a newly
incorporated subsidiary of Cooper.  This offer would value the existing issued
share capital of Laird at approximately 493 million pounds Sterling.  This
proposal represents a 35% premium to the Laird closing share price of 137.3
pence as of 15 June 2011 and is a 30% premium to the average closing price of
Laird's shares over the period of 12 months ended on 15 June 2011.  

The combination of Laird with Cooper's Bussmann division would create:

  * a leading electrical and electronics circuit protection, power management
    and industrial wireless business;
  * a compelling suite of electromagnetic interference, radio frequency and
    circuit protection components;
  * a world class power management product line complete with thermal
    management, power magnetics and signal integrity products;
  * a leading wireless business serving transportation, commercial
    construction, mining and  industrial customers; and
  * a business with the opportunity to realise financial performance
    commensurate with Cooper's operating discipline.

Cooper has a proven track record of successfully acquiring and integrating 34
companies over the past 7 years to build a portfolio of products and services
for our customers across industrial, utility, commercial and residential
markets.  Cooper has manufacturing facilities in 23 countries and commercial
operations in over 100 countries.  Globally, Cooper has approximately 25,000
employees worldwide, including approximately 4,100 in Europe, of which 2,100
are located in the United Kingdom.

Commenting on the proposed transaction, Cooper Chairman and CEO Kirk Hachigian
said, ""Laird has a strong product portfolio backed by a highly talented
engineering and R&D team.  Combining Bussmann's leading electronics and
industrial products with Laird's suite of performance material, components and
wireless system offerings, Cooper Industries would create a world class
portfolio of circuit protection, power management and industrial wireless
solutions.  Through this product portfolio combination, along with the benefit
of Cooper's proven financial and operating disciplines, we are able to provide
the Laird Board with a proposal that represents a significant premium in cash
to Laird's current share price.  We hope to engage the Board of Laird with the
goal of securing a recommended transaction.""

The announcement of any formal offer under Rule 2.5 of the Takeover Code would
be subject to the satisfaction of the following pre-conditions:

 a. Satisfactory completion of a limited, confirmatory due diligence review by
    Cooper and its professional advisors, including limited access to Laird
    management;
 b. Laird's Board, as advised by its financial advisors, unanimously and
    unconditionally recommending the formal offer;
 c. Each of the Directors of Laird giving firm irrevocable undertakings to
    Cooper to accept the offer in respect of all the Laird shares in which
    they have an interest;
 d. Irrevocable undertakings being received, in terms satisfactory to Cooper,
    from the main shareholders of Laird to accept the offer in respect of
    their Laird shares.  Cooper would expect to receive all reasonable
    assistance from the Board and management in promoting the transaction to
    Laird shareholders and other relevant stakeholders;
 e. Laird entering into a customary inducement fee and non-solicitation
    agreement;
 f. Approval of the final terms of the offer by Cooper's Board; and
 g. Agreement on the form of the Rule 2.5 announcement incorporating customary
    terms and conditions for a UK public offer.

RESERVATIONS

Cooper and Holdings reserve the right to revise or revoke the terms on which
this proposal is made, including the ability to waive some or all of the above
pre-conditions.  Cooper and Holdings reserve the right to announce an offer at
a price below 185 pence per Laird share in the event that:

 a. the Board of Laird agrees and recommends an offer at the reduced price;
 b. a third party announces a firm intention to make an offer for Laird;
 c. the issued and to be issued share capital of Laird comprises a greater
    number of ordinary shares than that which has been assumed;
 d. Laird announces, declares or pays a dividend or any other distribution to
    its shareholders; or
 e. There occurs a material event which negatively impacts the value of Laird.

SOURCES AND BASES

Unless otherwise stated, financial and other information concerning Laird and
Cooper has been extracted from published sources or from Cooper's management
sources.  

The value attributed to Laird's issued share capital is based on an assumed
number of Laird shares in issue of 266,302,206, as disclosed in Laird's 2010
annual report.

All prices for Laird shares have been derived from the company website and the
Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange and represent the closing
price on the relevant date.

Information in relation to the average closing price per Laird share over the
twelve month period ended 15 June 2011 is for the period from 16 June 2010 up
to and including 15 June, 2011 (only trading days are included in the
average).

ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 21, 2008
Spectrum Brands (the ""Company"") (NYSE: SPC) today announced that
it has signed a definitive agreement with Salton Inc. (""Salton"") and
its wholly owned subsidiary, Applica Pet Products LLC, for the sale of
its Global Pet Business for $692.5 million in cash and an aggregate
principal amount of the Company's subordinated debt securities equal
to $222.5 million less an amount equal to accrued and unpaid interest
on such subordinated debt securities since the dates of the last
interest payments thereon, which, depending on when the closing
occurs, could be an amount of up to approximately $6.5 million.

   Under and subject to the terms of the agreement, Salton will pay
the Company $692.5 million of the purchase price in cash and will
surrender a principal amount of the Company's Variable Rate Toggle
Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013, also referred to as PIK Notes,
equal to $98 million less an amount equal to accrued and unpaid
interest, and a principal amount of the Company's 7 3/8 percent Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2015 equal to $124.5 million less an amount
equal to accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, the agreement
between the parties provides that if the adjusted EBITDA derived from
the 2007 audited financial statements of the Global Pet Business is
more than $3 million less than $92.9 million, the purchase price will
be reduced by a multiple of 10 times the incremental difference. These
audited segment level results are required to be delivered to Salton
prior to the close of the sale. The Company does not currently
believe, based on available information, that any purchase price
adjustment related to the audited adjusted EBITDA will be required. In
addition, the purchase price is subject to adjustment for changes in
working capital prior to closing and certain expenses incurred in
connection with the sale. In the event of any purchase price increase
as a result of such adjustments, the proportion of the purchase price
that is paid in cash may be increased. Funding for the transaction
will be provided by an equity investment to Salton provided by
Harbinger Capital Partners Master Fund I, Ltd. and Harbinger Capital
Partners Special Situations Fund, L.P., the controlling stockholders
of Salton.

   Consistent with its previously communicated strategies, the
Company will apply the net cash proceeds from the sale to pay down a
portion of its ABL facility and other senior bank facilities in
accordance with the Company's debt agreements.

   ""The sale of our Global Pet Supply business for a full and fair
value is a critical step toward achieving one of our key priorities,
improving the overall capital structure of this company,"" said Kent
Hussey, Chief Executive Officer. ""We estimate that this transaction
will decrease our total leverage ratio of approximately 8.5 as of
March 30, 2008 to approximately 7.8 on a pro forma basis and will
provide greater flexibility to our remaining core businesses.
Additonally, we estimate that this transaction will decrease our
senior leverage ratio from approximately 5.0 as of March 30, 2008 to
approximately 4.0 on a pro forma basis."" The Company also estimates
that its annualized cash interest expense will be reduced by
approximately $70 million as a result of this transaction.

   Subject to approval of its senior lenders and certain regulatory
and other statutory notices and filings, the Company currently expects
the transaction to close by the end of August 2008.

   Sutherland acted as legal advisor to the Company and Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher Flom LLP also provided certain legal advice to
the Company in connection with the transaction. Goldman, Sachs & Co.
is acting as the Company's financial advisor.

   Non-GAAP Measurements

   Within this press release, reference is made to adjusted earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by management and frequently used by
the financial community which provides insight into an organization's
operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies,
since interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ
greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital
structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA can also be a useful
measure of a company's ability to service debt and is one of the
measures used for determining the Company's debt covenant compliance.
Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that are unusual in nature or
not comparable from period to period. The Company provides this
information to investors to assist in comparisons of past, present and
future operating results and to assist in highlighting the results of
on-going operations. While the Company's management believes that
adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental information, such adjusted
results are not intended to replace the Company's GAAP financial
results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.

sale pursuant to a plan under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the Transaction).

Nationstar expects the acquired Mortgage Servicing Assets to total
approximately $374 billion, including $201 billion in primary residential
mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) and $173 billion in subservicing contracts,
as measured by unpaid principal balances as of February 29, 2012,
approximately $1.8 billion of related servicing advance receivables and
certain other complimentary assets. The Transaction is expected to close in
late 2012, subject to the conditions and auction process described below.

Upon closing, the acquisition will make Nationstar the largest non-bank
residential mortgage loan servicer and one of the largest residential mortgage
loan originators in the United States. With this transaction, Nationstar
anticipates adding more than 2.4 million customers to a customer base of over
1 million, and growing its total servicing and sub-servicing book to
approximately $550 billion.

We believe this transaction will cement Nationstars position as the nations
pre-eminent non-bank mortgage servicer, and it reflects a record of servicing
performance that has made us a partner of choice in a transforming industry,
said Nationstar CEO Jay Bray. This potential transaction and our pending
acquisition of servicing rights from Aurora represent terrific opportunities
to acquire assets and operations from best-in-class servicers without the
burden of certain legacy liabilities.

In a performance-based, customer-focused servicing model like Nationstars,
the talent and experience of our people make the difference, said Bray. We
expect that many employees from Aurora will join our U.S.-based workforce, and
we look forward to working with many exceptional professionals from ResCap as
part of the Nationstar team. Together, our overriding mission will be
unchanged  to build on our heritage of providing our customers with
exceptional service and the benefit of Nationstars extensive resources to
help them achieve and preserve homeownership.

The cash purchase price of the mortgage servicing rights and subservicing
contracts would be approximately $700 million based on unpaid principal
balances as of February 29, 2012. The cash purchase price of the related
servicing advance receivables would be approximately $180 million, net of
financing, based on advance balances as of February 29, 2012. Nationstar
expects to enter into approximately $1.6 billion of advance financing
facilities to fund the balance of the related servicing advance receivables.
Approximately 68% of loans in the total portfolio (by unpaid principal
balance) are owned, insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or
Ginnie Mae.

Nationstar will fund up to approximately $450 million of the MSR purchase
price and cash purchase price for advances. Remaining funding is expected from
proceeds of a co-investment by Newcastle Investment Corp. (Newcastle) and
other Fortress-affiliated entities, whereby Nationstar will sell the right to
receive approximately 65% of the excess MSRs after receipt of a fixed basic
servicing fee per loan. Nationstar will retain approximately 35% of the excess
MSRs and all ancillary income associated with servicing the loans. Under the
terms of the investment, to the extent that any loans in this portfolio are
refinanced by Nationstar, the resulting mortgage servicing right will be
included in the portfolio, subject to certain limitations.

As contemplated by the Agreement, ResCap has voluntarily filed a Chapter 11
petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court and is seeking court approval to sell its
Mortgage Servicing Assets in an auction process supervised by the court.
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Nationstar has agreed to serve as the
stalking horse bidder for the auction of the Mortgage Servicing Assets.
Nationstars bid is subject to superior offers solicited as part of the
auction process as well as court and other approvals and conditions.

Nationstar anticipates that the court will approve in mid-June the auction
procedures and timeline for the sale of the Mortgage Servicing Assets and that
the auction process will last approximately 90 days, during which time ResCap
will solicit competing bids. If Nationstar is the successful bidder, then
ResCap will seek court approval to sell the Mortgage Servicing Assets to
Nationstar and the closing of the Transaction would be expected to occur in
late 2012. The auction timing and process is subject to the courts discretion
and may change.

The Agreement contains customary bid procedures and stalking horse
protections, including a $72 million break-up fee and reimbursement of up to
approximately $10 million of transaction-related expenses to be paid to
Nationstar if it is not the successful bidder in the auction process.

assumptions and existing information and involve certain risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from future
results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Important
factors that could affect these statements include, but are not limited to, a
delay in or a failure to obtain court approval of the auction procedures,
process, break-up fee or other terms of the Transaction; the receipt by ResCap
in the auction of an offer for the Mortgage Servicing Assets that is superior
to Nationstars offer; a delay in or failure to obtain financing for the
servicing advance facilities; the willingness of regulators to forbear from
regulatory actions that would impede the consummation of the Transaction;
proceedings due to inquiries by certain state Attorneys General, court
administrators and state and federal government agencies; the impact of the
ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act on Nationstars business
activities and practices, costs of operations and overall results of
operations; the impact on Nationstars servicing practices of enforcement
consent orders and agreements entered into by certain federal and state
agencies against the largest mortgage servicers; increased legal proceedings
and related costs; the continued deterioration of the residential mortgage
market, increase in monthly payments on adjustable rate mortgage loans,
adverse economic conditions, decrease in property values and increase in
delinquencies and defaults; the deterioration of the market for reverse
mortgages and increase in foreclosure rates for reverse mortgages;
Nationstars ability to efficiently service higher risk loans; Nationstars
ability to compete successfully in the mortgage loan servicing and mortgage
loan originations industries; Nationstars ability to scale-up appropriately
and integrate the assets, employees, operations and platforms related to the
Transaction; Nationstars ability to obtain sufficient capital to meet its
financing requirements, including, but not limited to, our ability to obtain
advance finance facilities sufficient to fund the purchase price for this
acquisition; changes to federal, state and local laws and regulations
concerning loan servicing, loan origination, loan modification or the
licensing of entities that engage in these activities; and the loss of
Nationstars licenses. These factors and other risks and uncertainties are
discussed in Nationstars annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

ended March 31, 2012, in each as filed or to be filed with the SEC.

PR Newswire

AKRON, Ohio, March 4, 2013

AKRON, Ohio, March 4, 2013 /PRNewswire/ --

  o $6.50 per share to be paid half in cash and half in shares of A. Schulman
    common stock
  o Offer represents an estimated total enterprise value of $855 million
    including equity value of $563 million
  o Offer represents a 25 percent premium over the closing price as of March
    1, 2013 of Ferro common stock and a 32 percent premium over
    volume-weighted average trading price over previous 60 days
  o Transaction expected to be accretive the first year following the
    acquisition

A. Schulman, Inc. (Nasdaq-GS: SHLM) announced today that it has made a
proposal to the Board of Directors of Ferro Corporation (NYSE: FOE) to acquire
all of the outstanding shares of Ferro common stock for per-share
consideration of $6.50, representing an estimated total enterprise value of
approximately $855 million including total indebtedness.  The offer represents
a 25 percent premium over the closing price of Ferro common stock on March 1,
2013, and a 32 percent premium over the volume-weighted average trading price
over the preceding 60-day period.

The Company said its proposed offer price of $6.50 per share includes an
immediate cash payment of $3.25 for each Ferro share outstanding and $3.25
worth of A. Schulman common stock.  When cost savings and synergies are fully
implemented, A. Schulman estimates annual savings of $35 million over and
above the previously announced Ferro targets.  Based on these additional
savings, A. Schulman believes that its offer presents the opportunity for
significant future value to Ferro shareholders through the equity portion of
the consideration.  A. Schulman stated that its offer was based upon publicly
available information about Ferro, which reported sales of approximately $1.2
billion through the first nine months of its fiscal year ended December 31,
2012.  However, with greater visibility into Ferro's businesses, A. Schulman
expects its offer could be adjusted subject to customary due diligence.

A. Schulman expressed its ""strong intent"" in pursuing the combination in a
letter to Ferro on February 13, 2013.  Ferro's Board rejected A. Schulman's
offer and expressed their belief that the company should remain independent. 
A. Schulman first contacted Ferro in November 2012.

""A. Schulman and Ferro are both recognized leaders in specialty chemicals with
value-added product lines, similar business models, complementary
competencies, markets and applications,"" said Joseph M. Gingo, Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer of A. Schulman.  ""We believe our
combination will deliver superior value to our respective shareholders and
offer better value to customers, and we would welcome the opportunity to
engage in a mutually beneficial dialogue with Ferro's Board and management.""

Gingo added, ""A. Schulman has demonstrated a proven ability to execute
reorganization, growth and acquisitions.  Ferro's business units align with A.
Schulman's core competencies with the exception of Pharmaceuticals, which is
not strategic to us.  We see substantial synergies and both geographic and
market growth opportunities resulting from this compelling combination, which
we would hope to be a consensual transaction.""

A. Schulman Financial Strength to Propel Accelerated Growth, Value Creation
""We have tremendous respect for Ferro and its people,"" said Gingo.  ""However,
cash flow is required not only for the restructuring efforts already publicly
identified by Ferro, but also for growth, the capacity to be opportunistic in
the marketplace, and the ability to create value for shareholders."" 

Over the past five years, A. Schulman has generated more than $400 million in
free cash flow.  By comparison, Ferro has generated approximately $60 million
during that same period.

Gingo added, ""A. Schulman's ability to generate strong free cash flow and its
successful track record of integrating acquisitions and recognizing synergies
ahead of schedule will help to accelerate and improve Ferro's value creation
timeline.  We also believe that incorporating Ferro's products and
technologies into our corporate growth strategies, which focus on adjacent
markets, new products and technologies, and cross-selling will provide a
powerful platform to enable profitable and sustainable growth and ensure
long-term, enhanced shareholder value.""

Since adopting a strategy in 2008 to move to higher-margin businesses and exit
low-margin businesses, A. Schulman has successfully executed consolidations,
restructurings and acquisition synergies that have been beneficial to the
Company over the past five years.  For example, with the 2010 acquisition of
ICO, Inc., the Company achieved $15 million of synergies one year ahead of
schedule. 

Gingo estimated that the acquisition of Ferro would provide annual synergies
of $35 million  including consolidation of corporate offices, integration of
the plastics business, pricing and sourcing efficiencies, cross selling and
value selling  in addition to Ferro's previously announced projected savings
of $50 million.

""In addition to the near-term synergies and potential restructuring
efficiencies, the long-term benefits to A. Schulman and Ferro shareholders
include substantially enhanced returns on invested capital and further growth
in higher-margin business segments and global markets.  We expect the proposed
transaction to be accretive in the first year following the acquisition. 

""Accordingly, we request the Ferro Board reconsider their expressed position
to remain independent.  We also encourage Ferro shareholders to communicate
with their Board, and ask them to re-examine their decision regarding our
offer.  We believe that our offer will bring attractive and timely value
creation to both Ferro and A. Schulman shareholders,"" stated Gingo.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This release includes certain financial information determined by methods
other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States (""GAAP"").  These non-GAAP financial measures include: net income
per diluted share excluding certain items and free cash flow. However,
non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for,
GAAP measures, and tables included in this release reconcile each non-GAAP
financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for these purposes are
net income per diluted share and net cash provided from (used in) operating
activities.  The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial
measures, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures to make decisions, assess
performance and allocate resources, and the Company believes that these
non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors for financial analysis.

While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide
useful supplemental information to investors, there are very significant
limitations associated with their use.  These non-GAAP financial measures are
not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be reported by all of the
Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled
measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the
exact method of calculation.  The Company compensates for these limitations by
using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial
measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial
measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.

Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements
A number of the matters discussed in this document that are not historical or
current facts deal with potential future circumstances and developments and
may constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be
identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current
facts and relate to future events and expectations. Forward-looking statements
contain such words as ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""project,"" ""intend,""
""plan,"" ""believe,"" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection
with any discussion of future operating or financial performance.
Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and
include known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of
which management is unable to predict or control, that may cause actual
results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed
or implied in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these
forward-looking statements, and that could adversely affect the Company's
future financial performance, include, but are not limited to, the following:

  o worldwide and regional economic, business and political conditions,
    including continuing economic uncertainties in some or all of the
    Company's major product markets or countries where the Company has
    operations;
  o the effectiveness of the Company's efforts to improve operating margins
    through sales growth, price increases, productivity gains, and improved
    purchasing techniques;
  o competitive factors, including intense price competition;
  o fluctuations in the value of currencies in major areas where the Company
    operates;
  o volatility of prices and availability of the supply of energy and raw
    materials that are critical to the manufacture of the Company's products,
    particularly plastic resins derived from oil and natural gas;
  o changes in customer demand and requirements;
  o effectiveness of the Company to achieve the level of cost savings,
    productivity improvements, growth and other benefits anticipated from
    acquisitions, joint ventures and restructuring initiatives; including any
    proposed combination with Ferro Corporation
  o escalation in the cost of providing employee health care;
  o uncertainties regarding the resolution of pending and future litigation
    and other claims;
  o the performance of the global automotive market; and
  o further adverse changes in economic or industry conditions, including
    global supply and demand conditions and prices for products.

The risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks the
Company faces. Additional risk factors that could affect the Company's
performance are set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended August 31, 2012. In addition, risks and uncertainties not
presently known to the Company or that it believes to be immaterial also may

    Recommended Cash Offer of SEK 215 per share in TradeDoubler

    AOL LLC (""AOL""), through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary Goldcup D
2389 AB (with a proposed change of name to AOLS Holdings AB) (""AOLS
Holdings""), a Swedish private limited liability company, today announces a
public cash offer to the holders of all issued and outstanding shares and
warrants of TradeDoubler AB (publ) (""TradeDoubler"") to tender all TradeDoubler
ordinary shares and warrants of series 2004/2007 and series 2006/2010 (other
than warrants held by TradeDoubler or any of its subsidiaries that are not
allocated as of the date hereof in respect of employee compensation
programs(1)) to AOLS Holdings (the ""Offer""). TradeDoubler is listed on the
Stockholm Stock Exchange (Stockholmsborsen) (the ""SSE"").  AOL is a majority-
owned subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. (""Time Warner"").


    Summary

     -- AOLS Holdings is offering SEK 215 per share in TradeDoubler (the
        ""Offer Price"").

     -- AOLS Holdings is also offering SEK 1,215 and SEK 39.50 for each
        warrant of series 2004/2007 and series 2006/2010, respectively.(2)

     -- The Offer Price represents a premium of 20% relative to the average
        volume weighted share prices of the TradeDoubler shares on the SSE for
        the ninety trading-day period prior to January 15, 2007, and a premium
        of 37% to the TradeDoubler share price on the SSE of SEK 156.50 on the
        first trading day after TradeDoubler third-quarter earnings were
        released on October 27, 2006.

     -- TradeDoubler's Board of Directors unanimously recommends the Offer.

     -- Shareholders representing in the aggregate approximately 20% of the
        issued and outstanding share capital and voting rights in TradeDoubler
        have irrevocably undertaken to accept the Offer.

     -- The acceptance period for the Offer is expected to run from the week
        of January 22, 2007 to the week of February 19, 2007.  Settlement of
        the Offer is expected to begin approximately a week after the end of
        the acceptance period.

    Background and Reasons for the Offer

    AOL has substantial experience in the e-commerce and internet advertising
industry.  A key part of AOL's strategy has been to capitalize on the growth
in online advertising and e-commerce.  In 2004, AOL acquired Advertising.com,
the largest display advertising network in the United States, with a presence
in eight European countries.  Advertising.com connects advertisers with online
advertising inventory by purchasing this inventory from publishers, and using
its proprietary optimization technology to determine the optimal advertising
to display on each individual inventory placement.  Advertising.com provides
measurable results for advertisers through its display and video networks as
well as its search engine management and lead generation services.

    Founded in 1999 and public since the completion of its IPO in 2005,
TradeDoubler is a European provider of online marketing and sales solutions.
AOL believes that a successful combination of Advertising.com and TradeDoubler
will capitalize on their complementary positions in the online advertising
marketplace.  The combination of Advertising.com and TradeDoubler will provide
advertisers with a more comprehensive range of marketing solutions and offer
publishers a broad selection of monetization opportunities, both in Europe and
in the United States.

    In connection with the preparation of the Offer, AOL has conducted limited
confirmatory due diligence on TradeDoubler.


    The Offer

    AOLS Holdings is offering SEK 215 in cash for each TradeDoubler ordinary
share and SEK 1,215 and SEK 39.50 in cash for each TradeDoubler warrant of
series 2004/2007 and series 2006/2010, respectively.  Pursuant to an exemption
received from the Swedish Securities Council (Ruling 2006:59), the Offer is
not being made in respect of any warrants currently held by TradeDoubler or
any of its subsidiaries that are not allocated as of the date hereof in
respect to employee compensation programs.  Accordingly, the Offer is being
extended in respect of (i) 94,391 warrants in the 2004/2007 series and (ii)
867,300 warrants in the 2006/2010 series.  The Offer Price and the prices
offered for the warrants are subject to adjustment should TradeDoubler pay any
dividend or make any other value transfer (vardeoverforing) prior to the
settlement of the Offer.

    No commission will be charged to holders of TradeDoubler ordinary shares
and warrants in the Offer.

    The Offer Price represents a premium of 20% relative to the average volume
weighted share prices of the TradeDoubler shares on the SSE for the ninety
trading-day period prior to January 15, 2007, and represents a premium of 37%
to the TradeDoubler share price on the SSE of SEK 156.50 on the first trading
day after TradeDoubler third-quarter earnings were released on October 27,
2006.  In addition, the Offer Price represents a premium of 9% to the closing
share price of the TradeDoubler shares on the SSE of SEK 198 on January 12,
2007, the last trading day before the announcement of the Offer.

    The total value of the Offer amounts to SEK 6,332 million (based on
28,015,287 ordinary shares outstanding and 94,391 warrants of series 2004/2007
and 867,300 warrants of series 2006/2010 that are allocated in employee
compensation programs).

    None of Time Warner, AOL or AOLS Holdings currently owns or controls any
TradeDoubler ordinary shares or warrants.


    Recommendation from TradeDoubler's Board of Directors

    The Board of Directors of TradeDoubler unanimously recommends that holders
of all issued and outstanding TradeDoubler ordinary shares and warrants accept
the Offer.


    Agreement with TradeDoubler

    AOL and TradeDoubler entered into an Offer Agreement on January 14, 2007,
pursuant to which AOL has agreed to make the Offer, subject to the terms and
conditions described herein.  TradeDoubler has recommended the Offer to the
holders of TradeDoubler ordinary shares and warrants.  The parties have also
agreed to cooperate and take all actions necessary or advisable to consummate
and make effective the Offer, including but not limited to, the fulfillment of
the conditions to the Offer.  TradeDoubler has also agreed not to solicit,
initiate, seek or encourage any inquiry, proposal or offer from or initiate
any discussions or negotiations from a third party for TradeDoubler.  Nothing
in the Offer Agreement restrains the Board of Directors of TradeDoubler from
taking all actions necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties.

          the owner of more than 90 percent of the total number of shares in
          TradeDoubler on a fully diluted basis;

    (ii)  that no other party announces an offer to acquire shares in
          TradeDoubler on terms that are more favorable than the Offer to the
          shareholders in TradeDoubler;

    (iii) with respect to the Offer and the acquisition of TradeDoubler,
          receipt of all necessary regulatory, governmental or similar

          authorities, in each case on terms which, in AOLS Holdings' opinion,
          are acceptable;

    (iv)  neither the Offer nor the acquisition of TradeDoubler is wholly or
          partly prevented or materially adversely affected by any legislation
          or other regulation, court decision, public authority decision or
          similar circumstance, which is actual or could reasonably be
          anticipated, outside the control of AOLS Holdings and which AOLS
          Holdings could not reasonably have foreseen at the time of the
          announcement of the Offer;

    (v)   that, save as publicly announced by TradeDoubler prior to the date
          the Offer was announced or as otherwise disclosed in writing to AOLS
          Holdings prior to that date, AOLS Holdings does not discover that
          any information publicly disclosed by TradeDoubler or otherwise made
          available to AOLS Holdings is materially inaccurate or misleading or
          that any material information which should have been publicly
          disclosed by TradeDoubler has not been so disclosed;

    (vi)  there being no circumstances, which AOLS Holdings did not have
          knowledge about at the time of the announcement of the Offer, that
          have occurred that have a material adverse effect upon
          TradeDoubler's sales, results, liquidity, assets or equity; and

    (vii) that TradeDoubler does not take any measures that typically are
          intended to impair the prerequisites for the implementation of the
          Offer.


    AOLS Holdings reserves the right to withdraw the Offer made in the event
that it is clear that any of the above conditions are not fulfilled or cannot
be fulfilled. However, with regard to conditions (iii)-(vii), such withdrawal
will only be made provided that the defective fulfillment of such condition is
of material importance to AOLS Holdings' acquisition of shares in
TradeDoubler.

    AOLS Holdings reserves the right to waive, in whole or in part, one or
more of the conditions above in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations, including, with respect to condition (i) above, to complete the

Goldman Sachs for $20 Per Share in Cash

ATLANTA, May 1, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ebix, Inc., (Nasdaq:EBIX), a leading
international supplier of On-Demand software and E-commerce services to the
insurance industry, today announced that it has entered into a definitive
merger agreement to be acquired by an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co.
(""Goldman Sachs"") in a transaction valued at approximately $820 million,
including the assumption of any outstanding debt.

Under the terms of the agreement, Ebix shareholders will receive $20.00 per
share in cash. This represents a premium of approximately 18% over Ebix's
average daily closing price over the preceding 30 days.

""After considering a number of potential alternatives, the Ebix board, acting
on the recommendation of a special committee comprised entirely of independent
directors, unanimously approved this transaction, which provides significant
and immediate value to shareholders,"" said Robin Raina, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Ebix. ""With our market-leading servicing platforms and
talented team of insurance and technology professionals, Ebix will be
well-positioned as a private company to continue to execute on our strategic
initiatives and pursue growth opportunities around the world.""        

""We have great respect for Ebix and its strong commitment to providing
customers with the highest quality of software and E-commerce services in the
insurance industry,"" said Sumit Rajpal, Managing Director, Goldman Sachs. ""We
look forward to working with the Company and helping it maximize its growth
potential.""

The board of directors of Ebix, on the unanimous recommendation of a special
committee of independent directors of the board, has approved the merger
agreement and has resolved to recommend that Ebix shareholders approve the
transaction. Robin Raina and the Rennes Fondation, which together own
approximately 19% of the outstanding common shares, have entered into separate
voting agreements under which they have agreed, subject to certain exceptions,
to vote their respective shares in favor of the proposed transaction. Robin
Raina and the Rennes Fondation will continue to be meaningful equity investors
in Ebix.

The merger agreement contains a ""go-shop"" provision under which Ebix may
solicit alternative proposals from third parties during the next 45 calendar
days on customary terms and conditions for transactions of this nature. Ebix's
special committee, with the assistance of its advisors, will actively solicit
acquisition proposals during this period. There can be no assurances that this
process will result in any alternative transaction.

The proposed transaction is subject to antitrust approvals, shareholder
approval and other customary closing conditions. The transaction, which is not
conditioned upon financing, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2013.
At that time, Ebix will become a private company and its shares will no longer
be listed on any public exchange. 

Ebix will be submitting a current report on Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") containing a summary of terms and
conditions of the proposed transaction and merger agreement.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC acted as financial advisor to the special committee
of the board of Ebix and has provided a fairness opinion in connection with
the transaction. Alston & Bird LLP and Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A. acted
as legal advisors to the special committee. 

Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Credit Suisse AG acted as financial advisors to
Goldman Sachs and have provided debt financing commitments for the
transaction. Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP acted as legal advisor to Goldman
Sachs.

    PITTSBURGH, Jan. 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- CONSOL Energy Inc.
(NYSE: CNX) intends to offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of CNX
Gas Corporation (NYSE: CXG) that it does not currently own in a stock-for-
stock transaction.  CONSOL Energy currently owns approximately 81.7 percent of
the approximately 151 million shares of CNX Gas common stock outstanding.
CONSOL Energy will offer CNX Gas stockholders 0.4425 shares of CONSOL Energy
common stock for each outstanding share of CNX Gas common stock that CONSOL
Energy does not own, the equivalent of $33.70 per share for CNX Gas common
stock, or a 12 percent premium based upon the closing stock price of CNX Gas
on January 28, 2008.  The transaction is valued at approximately $932 million.

    CONSOL Energy's offer will be made directly to the CNX Gas stockholders
and will not be conditioned upon any requirement for recommendation of its
offer by the independent directors of CNX Gas.  The CONSOL Energy exchange
offer will be conditioned upon, among other things, the tender of a majority
of the outstanding shares of CNX Gas common stock not owned by CONSOL Energy,
without regard to any shares of CNX Gas that are owned by the directors or
management of either CONSOL Energy or CNX Gas.  This condition will be
irrevocable.  The exchange offer will also be subject to other customary terms
and conditions and is intended to be tax-free to the shareholders of CNX Gas.

    Assuming that the conditions to CONSOL Energy's exchange offer are
satisfied and that the offer is completed, consistent with the requirements of
Delaware law, CONSOL Energy intends to effect a ""short form"" merger of CNX Gas
with a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy promptly thereafter.  In this subsequent
merger, the remaining CNX Gas public stockholders will be entitled to receive
the same consideration as is paid in the exchange offer.  Under Delaware law,
appraisal rights will also be available to the former stockholders of CNX Gas
as a result of the merger.  CONSOL Energy does not intend to take any
retributive action should its exchange offer be unsuccessful.

    ""We have always believed that a diversified energy portfolio of coal and
gas, which combined account for two-thirds of fuel for U.S. electricity
generation, is a winning combination,"" said J.  Brett Harvey, president and
chief executive officer.  ""The acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares
of CNX Gas will give us the greatest flexibility in the access, allocation and
utilization of our capital in growing that diversified portfolio.""

    Harvey said a number of factors have changed since CNX Gas went public.
""Two years ago, financial markets did not understand or properly value the gas
assets and operations of CONSOL Energy,"" Harvey said.  ""In the two years since
we established CNX Gas as a public company, its visibility and transparency
have improved, and financial markets appear to have a greater appreciation for
its value, as evidenced by the significant growth in the market value of CNX
Gas.""

    Harvey went on to explain that as the majority owner of CNX Gas, CONSOL
Energy had to make a decision regarding the gas company's future. CONSOL
Energy concluded that it has no interest in selling or otherwise divesting
itself of the shares of CNX Gas that it currently owns.  ""We chose to stick to
our strategy of energy asset diversification, and hence to offer to re-acquire
the remaining shares of the gas company.""


    Harvey also said that energy markets over the next ten years will be
affected increasingly by public policy issues, both in the United States and
globally.  ""It is becoming increasingly apparent,"" he said, ""that carbon
constraints will become a part of energy regulation in the United States. Such
constraints pose challenges for all fossil fuels, but would affect gas to a
lesser extent than coal or petroleum.""

    Harvey said neither the United States nor the world will turn its back on
coal because the energy produced from coal is vital to raising the prosperity
of people around the world.  ""But substantially reducing carbon dioxide
emissions produced when coal is consumed will become an essential predicate to
its continued use,"" he argued.  ""From the CONSOL Energy stockholders'
perspective, increasing the portion of gas in our energy portfolio is a
prudent step to manage the risk associated with carbon controls, because with
its lower emissions, gas will become more valuable in the near term.""

    Harvey added, however, that CONSOL Energy expects its coal portfolio to
perform well during the transition period when the impacts of carbon
constraints begin to be felt.  ""Coal will not be eliminated from the U.S.
energy mix because we need the energy,"" he said.  ""But there could be some
winnowing of coal producers if carbon constraints shrink the market for coal
in the short run.  Most of our major mining operations are well capitalized
and have a substantial reserve base.  Existing coal mines with that type of
profile will do very well.""

    Harvey said the integration of CNX Gas into CONSOL Energy is expected to
result in cost savings and certain business synergies.  ""We expect there to be
a significant reduction in administrative costs, particularly those imposed on
any public enterprise for compliance and reporting,"" he said.

    Harvey said CONSOL Energy is in the process of preparing the necessary
documentation to file its exchange offer and related documentation with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. ""We intend to launch our offer in the
coming days and expect to complete this transaction in the first half of
2008,"" he concluded.

    Various statements in this document, including those that express a
belief, expectation, or intention, as well as those that are not statements of
historical fact, are forward-looking statements (as defined in Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995). The forward-looking statements may include projections
and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects
(including statements relating to the timing of and satisfaction of conditions
to the exchange offer and merger with CNX Gas and whether any of the
anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized), our future
production, revenues, income and capital spending. When we use the words
""believe,"" ""intend,"" ""expect,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""anticipate,"" ""could,""
""would,"" ""will,"" ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""predict,"" ""project,"" or their negatives,
or other similar expressions, the statements which include those words are
usually forward-looking statements. When we describe strategy that involves
risks or uncertainties, we are making forward-looking statements. The forward-
looking statements in this document speak only as of the date of this
document; we disclaim any obligation to update these statements unless
required by securities law, and we caution you not to rely on them unduly. We
have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and
assumptions about future events.  While our management considers these
expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to
significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks,
contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and
many of which are beyond our control.  These risks, uncertainties and
contingencies include, but are not limited to: timing of the exchange offer
transaction, acceptance of the exchange offer by the requisite number of
shares and the satisfaction of the other conditions to the exchange offer;
market acceptance of acquiring the minority interest of CNX Gas, an extended
decline in prices we receive for our coal and gas affecting our operating
results and cash flows; reliance on customers extending existing contracts or
entering into new long-term contracts for coal; reliance on major customers;
our inability to collect payments from customers if their creditworthiness
declines; the disruption of rail, barge and other systems that deliver our
coal, or pipeline systems which deliver our gas; a loss of our competitive
position because of the competitive nature of the coal industry and the gas
industry, or a loss of our competitive position because of overcapacity in
these industries impairing our profitability; our inability to hire qualified
people to meet replacement or expansion needs; coal users switching to other
fuels in order to comply with various environmental standards related to coal
combustion; the inability to produce a sufficient amount of coal to fulfill
our customers' requirements which could result in our customers initiating
claims against us; the risks inherent in coal mining being subject to
unexpected disruptions, including geological conditions, equipment failure,
timing of completion of significant construction or repair of equipment,
fires, accidents and weather conditions which could cause our results to
deteriorate; increases in the price of commodities used in our mining
operations and could impact our cost of production; obtaining governmental
permits and approvals for our operations; the effects of government
regulation; the effects of stringent federal and state safety regulations; the
effects of mine closing, reclamation and certain other liabilities;
uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal and gas
reserves; we do not insure against all potential operating risks; the outcomes
of various legal proceedings, which proceedings are more fully described in
our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; increased
exposure to employee related long-term liabilities; our participation in
multi-employer pension plans may expose us to obligations beyond the
obligation to our employees; lump sum payments made to retiring salaried
employees pursuant to our defined benefit pension plan; our ability to comply
with laws or regulations requiring that we obtain surety bonds for workers'
compensation and other statutory requirements; acquisitions that we recently
have made or may make in the future including the accuracy of our assessment
of the acquired businesses and their risks, achieving any anticipated
synergies, integrating the acquisitions and unanticipated changes that could
affect assumptions we may have made; the anti-takeover effects of our rights
plan could prevent a change of control; risks in exploring for and producing
gas; new gas development projects and exploration for gas in areas where we
have little or no proven gas reserves; the availability of field services,
equipment and personnel for drilling and producing gas; replacing our natural
gas reserves which if not replaced will cause our gas reserves and gas
production to decline; costs associated with perfecting title for gas rights
in some of our properties; we need to use unproven technologies to extract
coalbed methane on some of our properties; location of a vast majority of our
gas producing properties in three counties in southwestern Virginia, making us
vulnerable to risks associated with having our gas production concentrated in
one area; other persons could have ownership rights in our advanced gas
extraction techniques which could force us to cease using those techniques or
pay royalties; the coalbeds from which we produce methane gas frequently
contain water that may hamper production; and other factors discussed in our
2006 Form 10-K under ""Risk Factors,"" as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs,
which are on file at the Securities and Exchange Commission and to be set
forth in our Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the exchange offer to CNX
Gas' stockholders.

the stockholders of CNX Gas Corporation, CONSOL Energy expects to file a

Visteon will offer KRW 28,500 per share, representing a premium of
approximately 15 percent to HCC's share trading price on the Korean exchange
on July 4. The offer is being funded through a fully committed local financing
facility of KRW 1 trillion. 

Visteon also announced its intent to further invest in Korea to generate
continued advanced technologies for radiators, condensers, evaporators and
heater cores. Visteon intends to invest $50 million to build a
state-of-the-art wind tunnel and to expand its manufacturing footprint in
Korea, including establishing the world's largest variable swashplate
compressor production capability.

The transaction will strengthen Visteon's climate business through a more
efficient operating structure and demonstrates the company's commitment to a
long-term, global presence in the automotive climate control sector. HCC's
strength in developing advanced powertrain cooling technologies will support
and complement Visteon's strong research and development capabilities in the
U.S. and Germany, leading to continued advanced products for customers and
future growth.

Halla Climate Control will retain its well-known brand name, and its highly
respected Korean management team will remain in place and continue to fulfill
its roles and responsibilities. The reporting structure of the organization
will remain as it is today.

""Visteon is committed to the long-term success of our climate business,"" said
Don Stebbins, Visteon chairman, chief executive officer and president. ""Full
ownership of HCC is an important next step in ensuring our continued global
competitiveness.

""This transaction will pave the way for HCC to play an even greater role in
the global climate market while reinforcing its leadership position in Korea,""
Stebbins added. ""It also will facilitate future investment in climate
technology and fully leverage the companies' combined strengths and synergies
in engineering, manufacturing, purchasing and finance.""

Since obtaining majority ownership of HCC from Ford Motor Company in 1999,
Visteon has supported HCC's approximately $1 billion investment to become a
more competitive global supplier, building on HCC's strong reputation in
Korea.

""World-class engineering is at the heart of Visteon and Halla success,""
Stebbins said. ""We expect to hire additional engineering talent in the future,
in Korea and other key markets, to drive innovation and to help our customers
address new technology, environmental and regulatory trends.""

As the world's second largest automotive climate control systems supplier,
Visteon and Halla Climate Control provide a wide range of products including
heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, compressors, fluid
transport and powertrain cooling products.

The transaction has the unanimous support of Visteon's board of directors.
Goldman Sachs and Rothschild are acting as financial advisors to Visteon.

  BETHESDA, Md., Sept. 11

BETHESDA, Md., Sept. 11 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.
(NYSE: HST) today announced that its joint venture in the Netherlands with
Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, the Dutch pension fund for public employees, and
an affiliate of GIC Real Estate Pte Ltd, the real estate investment company of
the government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd, entered into an
agreement to purchase six hotels comprising 1,954 rooms in three countries for
approximately euro 565 million. The purchase price includes the assumption of
approximately euro 434 million of debt at an interest rate under 6%. The
acquisition price represents a significant discount to replacement cost and
provides the venture with further geographic diversification into France and
Germany. These properties will benefit from recent significant capital
investment of over euro 80 million and are located in prime urban markets that
have strong room rate performance and low supply growth. Upon closing, the
European Joint Venture will be fully funded and invested, owning 17 hotels
with nearly 5,500 rooms in eight countries. The purchase is subject to
regulatory approvals and other closing conditions and is expected to close
later this year.

               Transaction Valued at Approximately $716 Million

                                       

COVINGTON, Ky., August 23, 2011 - Omnicare, Inc. (NYSE:OCR) today announced
that it has sent a letter to PharMerica Corporation (NYSE:PMC) proposing to
purchase all of the outstanding shares of PharMerica common stock for $15.00
per share in cash.  The transaction is valued at approximately $716 million,
which includes PharMerica's net debt.

Omnicare's all-cash proposal represents a 37.2% premium over PharMerica's
closing stock price on August 22, 2011 and a 25.9% premium over the average
closing price for the one-month period ended August 22, 2011.

""PharMerica represents an excellent strategic fit for Omnicare,"" said John
Figueroa, chief executive officer of Omnicare.  ""We believe this proposal
presents a compelling opportunity for PharMerica stockholders to realize value
for their shares not likely to be available in the market place or in other
business combination opportunities.  Bringing together our complementary
businesses would enable the combined company to benefit from enhanced scale
and operational efficiencies, and a broader array of service offerings.  In
addition, the proposed transaction is consistent with the country's effort to
lower overall healthcare costs and is expected to help our customers manage
and respond to the ongoing industry cost pressures.  Omnicare has a proven
track record of integrating companies to maximize value for stockholders and
to best serve its customers.""

""We look forward to PharMerica's careful consideration of our proposal and an
open dialogue with its Board of Directors to complete this transaction.  We
are surprised that PharMerica has declined our repeated efforts to engage in
negotiations, particularly as it was PharMerica who first approached us
regarding a transaction.  Working together, we believe we can reach a mutually
agreeable transaction in a quick and efficient manner that will benefit both
companies and their respective stockholders and other constituencies.  While
it remains our strong preference to reach a negotiated agreement with
PharMerica, should they continue to refuse to engage with us regarding this
potential value-creating transaction, we plan to submit our proposal directly
to PharMerica stockholders,"" added Mr. Figueroa.

Omnicare believes that the complementary nature of the two companies will
create a combined company that is uniquely positioned to generate substantial
value for its stockholders and other constituencies.  As a combined company,
Omnicare and PharMerica will continue to offer the high-quality services that
customers have come to expect.  The combined company will be a recognized
leader in generic utilization and other drug cost management programs and its
customers, employees and other constituencies will benefit from:

  * High Quality Technology and Service Offerings. Omniview offers a range of
    innovative cost-saving solutions, including admissions preview, e-refill,
    proof of delivery tracking, drug management reports, and real-time
    validation of Part D coverability.  Additionally, Omnicare's investments
    in automation have resulted in greater accuracy, speed and consistency of
    service and freed up resources and time for the people who serve customers
    face-to-face.  Finally, through the use of a proprietary document imaging
    system, Omnicare has simplified the order entry process, resulting in
    significantly improved turnaround times.  Taken together, Omnicare's
    sophisticated technology and systems can greatly enhance PharMerica's
    current service levels while also reducing costs. 

  * Formulary Management.   Omnicare's Clinical Intervention Centers, which
    provide clinically appropriate and financially cost-effective,
    patient-specific medication therapy and other formulary management
    initiatives, are expected to help customers of the combined company
    identify and reduce drug costs.   

  * Purchasing Ability and Speed to Market with Generics.   The combined
    company's purchasing ability is expected to provide cost savings to
    customers of the combined company, especially with regard to generics, and
    will allow them to benefit from the coming wave of brand drug patent
    expirations.  Omnicare's ability to convert over 95% of a brand product to
    its generic equivalent in a matter of a few weeks provides almost
    immediate cost savings to its customers. 

Omnicare noted that its Board unanimously supports this proposal.  The
proposal is not subject to any financing contingencies.

The proposal is subject to confirmatory due diligence and the negotiation of
definitive documentation. With regard to regulatory approvals, the
institutional pharmacy business is competitive and will remain so after the
transaction.  The Federal Trade Commission has already examined this industry,
noted the numerous players and explained how relatively easy entry and other
market conditions facilitate competition.  Omnicare would not pursue a
transaction unless it believed it could close expeditiously.  

Goldman, Sachs & Co. is acting as financial advisor to Omnicare and Dewey &
LeBoeuf LLP and Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider LLP are acting as legal counsel.

Omnicare has delivered its proposal to PharMerica's Board of Directors.  Below
is the text of the letter that was sent today to PharMerica's Board of
Directors:

 

The Board of Directors of PharMerica Corporationc/o Gregory S. Weishar, Chief
Executive Officer and DirectorPharMerica Corporation1901 Campus
PlaceLouisville, KY 40299

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

As conveyed to you in my letter dated July 19, 2011, the Board of Directors of
Omnicare, Inc. (""Omnicare"") has authorized me to propose that Omnicare acquire
PharMerica Corporation (""PharMerica"") in a negotiated transaction in which
PharMerica's stockholders would receive $15.00 in cash per share of PharMerica
common stock.  

We have considered exploring a combination with PharMerica for some time and
have intensified our analysis of such a transaction since your CEO approached
me and proposed such a transaction on April 19, 2011.  Since that time, I have
spoken to your CEO several times and have sent him letters dated July 8, 2011
and July 19, 2011 to express our interest in a potential business combination
with PharMerica.  We are surprised that you have repeatedly declined our
efforts to engage in good faith negotiations regarding a possible
value-creating transaction between our companies, as it is our understanding
that you are exploring strategic alternatives.  Our goal remains to work with
you to agree to a negotiated transaction.  However, due to your unwillingness
to engage in discussions and the unique opportunity our proposal presents for
your stockholders to realize the full value of their shares, we are compelled
to disclose this proposal to your stockholders.

As I have indicated several times, we strongly believe that there are clear
and compelling advantages to both Omnicare and PharMerica from a combination
of our two companies and that such a transaction would be extremely beneficial
to your stockholders.  At $15.00 per share, our proposal represents a premium
of 37.2% over your closing stock price on August 22, 2011 and 25.9% over the
average closing price for the one-month period ended August 22, 2011.  We also
believe that bringing our two companies together would benefit your employees,
customers and other constituencies through, among other things, the enhanced
scale, operational efficiencies and broader array of service offerings.

This proposal is based solely upon our review of publicly available
information regarding PharMerica.  It is, therefore, subject to confirmatory
due diligence and the negotiation of definitive documentation.  Additionally,
this proposal is not subject to any financing contingencies.

We believe that we will be able to expeditiously close the proposed
transaction.  We and our legal advisors have tried repeatedly to engage in a
constructive dialogue with you and your legal advisors regarding the proposed
transaction.  Unfortunately, you have been unwilling to afford us with a
meaningful opportunity to demonstrate to you the basis for such belief.  

I want to re-emphasize to you our seriousness about this proposal.  We are
committed to a combination of our respective companies and believe it would
offer an excellent opportunity to your stockholders to realize the full value
of their shares to an extent not likely to be available in the market place or
in other business combination opportunities.  We firmly believe, and trust
that you will agree, that it is in the best interest of your stockholders to
provide us with the requested due diligence opportunity and commence
negotiations.

As stated previously, we are prepared to devote all necessary resources to the
completion of due diligence, the negotiation and execution of definitive
documentation and the consummation of a transaction in an expeditious manner.
 We have retained Goldman, Sachs & Co. as our financial advisor and Dewey &
LeBoeuf LLP and Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider LLP as our legal advisors to assist
us.  

Our strong preference is to work with PharMerica to negotiate a mutually
acceptable transaction.  We and our advisors are prepared to meet with you and
your advisors to discuss all aspects of our proposal.  However, if you
continue to refuse to engage in meaningful negotiations, we are prepared to
submit our proposal directly to your stockholders.  

We urge you to reconsider our proposal.  We look forward to hearing from you
promptly.

Sincerely,

/s/ John Figueroa

John Figueroa
Chief Executive Officer

By Young-Sam Cho and Gautam Chakravorthy
     Sept. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Videocon Industries Ltd. and New York
buyout fund Ripplewood Holdings LLC are set to buy Daewoo
Electronics Corp. for about 680 billion won ($711 million), the
Indian company's third electronics acquisition since last year.
     Videocon Chairman Venugopal Dhoot confirmed the offer and
declined to comment on other financial details until an
announcement later today. The Aurangabad-based company and its
U.S. partner won exclusive negotiating rights to buy Daewoo,
creditor Woori Bank said earlier today.
     The acquisition will help Videocon, which has bought Thomson
SA's television-tube business and Electrolux AB's Indian
appliance unit since 2005, expand its product line to include
washing machines and televisions produced by South Korea's third-
largest electronics maker. Videocon is also looking for
acquisitions in the U.S., Dhoot said.
     ``We want to grow exponentially,'' Dhoot said in a telephone
interview. ``We're on an acquisition spree.''
     Videocon doesn't need to raise funds for the purchase
because the company has more than $500 million in cash, he said.
     Woori Bank and Daewoo's other creditors plan to sign an
agreement this month, according to the statement. Buyout fund MBK
Partners will inherit the negotiating rights should talks with
Videocon collapse, according to the statement.
     The Seoul-based electronics maker, a former unit of the
Daewoo Group that collapsed in 1999, posted a 94 billion won loss
last year, compared with a 30 billion won profit in 2004, after
sales declined 6.4 percent to 2.2 trillion won. Daewoo's book
value, or assets minus liabilities, was 375 billion won at the
end of last year, according to its latest regulatory filing.
     Videocon shares, which have declined 2.4 percent this year,
rose 6.45 rupees, or 1.6 percent, to 415 rupee as of 12:46 p.m.
in Mumbai on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

$700 Million purchase to establish Capital One as a leader in growing prepaid
market

Expected break even impact to GAAP EPS in 2008; accretive in 2009


    MCLEAN, Va., Aug. 7 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Capital One Financial
Corporation (NYSE: COF) today announced that it has entered into a definitive
agreement under which it will acquire NetSpend Holdings, Inc., the parent
company of NetSpend Corporation, a leading retail marketer of prepaid debit
cards, for $700 million in an all-cash transaction.

    On a GAAP basis, the transaction, including the associated integration
costs, is not expected to have a material effect on Capital One's earnings per
share in 2007 or in 2008, and is expected to be accretive in 2009.  On an
operating basis, excluding integration costs, the transaction is expected to
be accretive in 2008.

    ""This transaction is financially compelling,"" said Scott Grimes, Capital
One's Senior Vice President, Payments.  ""NetSpend is profitable today, and
based on extensive due diligence, we're confident that the combined
capabilities of both companies position us to deliver strong profit growth in
the future.""

    The prepaid debit market is experiencing significant growth, is attractive
to a wide range of consumers, and leverages Capital One's core strengths in
credit cards and banking.  Prepaid debit cards offer a flexible, safe and
reliable alternative to cash for millions of consumers. The acquisition will
expand upon the company's existing strategic partnership with NetSpend and
further Capital One's ability to offer consumers a broader range of payment
solutions while extending its brand through NetSpend's strong retail presence.

    ""Capital One offers innovative debit and credit products to help meet
consumers' needs regardless of how they spend and manage their money,"" said
Grimes. ""With NetSpend's broad network of merchant partners, this acquisition
immediately adds a powerful channel and further extends Capital One's prepaid
solutions to the retail environment.""

    With more than 1.5 million active customers nationwide, NetSpend has one
of the most convenient and accessible retail networks in the country,
including more than 15,000 locations where cards can be purchased and 50,000
locations where funds can be loaded onto the card.  In addition, NetSpend
offers products and services online through its website.

    NetSpend's Chief Executive Officer, Richard Savard, will continue to lead
the prepaid business after the acquisition has been finalized and will assume
a key executive role within Capital One's Payments business.

    ""We consider Capital One to be among the best payment and card marketers
in the country,"" said Savard.  ""This transaction is the natural next step for
our company.  It enables us to accelerate the success we have had addressing
the 70 million U.S. citizens who lack or choose not to have a traditional bank
account.  Combining our resources with Capital One expands NetSpend's ability
to deliver products that drive sales and loyalty for our merchant partners.
As an important part of Capital One, we look forward to driving our business
and the prepaid industry to the next level.""

    NetSpend's proprietary, end-to-end approach is scalable and customizable,
delivering cost benefits and revenue building opportunities to partners.
NetSpend distribution relationships with leading retailers include Safeway,
Pathmark, HEB Grocery Stores, and ACE America's Cash Express. NetSpend manages
all aspects of the debit card lifecycle, from the card design and approval
processes with partners and associations, to production, packaging,
distribution, and personalization. NetSpend also oversees inventory and
security controls, renewals, lost and stolen card management and replacement.

    Under the terms of the agreement, NetSpend will become a subsidiary of
Capital One, N.A. The transaction, which was approved by the board of
directors of Capital One and NetSpend is subject to customary regulatory
approvals and notifications and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of
2007.

    The company cautions that current expectations in this release for
earnings, synergies and strategy are forward-looking statements and actual
results could differ materially from current expectations due to a number of
factors, including competition in the prepaid, debit, and gift card business;
the company's ability to integrate operational and distribution platforms; and
general economic conditions affecting consumer income and spending. A
discussion of these and other factors can be found in Capital One's annual
reports and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
including, but not limited to, Capital One's report on Form 10-k for the
fiscal year 2007.

Management, Inc.

  PR Newswire

  BOCA RATON, Fla., Aug. 25

BOCA RATON, Fla., Aug. 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Enterprise Acquisition
Corp. (""Enterprise"") (Amex: EST) announced today that it has signed a
definitive merger agreement pursuant to which it will merge with WF Capital
Holding Inc. (""WF Capital""), the privately-held parent of Workflow Management,
Inc. (""Workflow""), one of the leading providers of managed print and
promotional production and fulfillment solutions in North America. Workflow
also has entered into a letter of intent and a purchase agreement to acquire
two additional businesses in the marketing services and promotional production
solutions industry, which may be completed prior to the closing of the merger
with Enterprise. Workflow generated approximately $1.2 billion in revenue in
2007, on a pro forma basis to reflect the two pending acquisitions.

The shares of Workflow will be acquired by Enterprise for an aggregate
purchase price of $669.0 million, which does not include the value of the
management incentive share grant and which will consist of the assumption of
up to $490.0 million in existing Workflow indebtedness and $179.0 million in
Enterprise common stock to Workflow's stockholders. To the extent that the
indebtedness of Workflow is less or greater than $490 million at the closing
of the merger, the common stock portion of the purchase price will be adjusted
accordingly. In addition to the aggregate purchase price, management will be
eligible to receive bonus payments of up to $50.0 million based on (i) the
market performance of the combined entity's publicly traded shares following
the merger or (ii) warrant exercises assuming the price of Enterprise common
stock is trading over $10.00 per share.

Consummation of the merger is conditioned on the Enterprise stockholders
approving the merger, and the holders of fewer than 30 percent of the shares
of Enterprise common stock held by public stockholders voting against the
merger and exercising their right to convert their shares into a pro-rata
portion of Enterprise's trust fund prior to the anticipated completion of the
merger and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and other customary
closing conditions. Enterprise expects to file a preliminary proxy statement
concerning the merger as soon as possible, which will be subject to review by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Assuming the closing conditions are
met, Enterprise anticipates completing the transaction in the fourth quarter
of 2008 or the first quarter of 2009.

The current management of Workflow will remain in place to run the combined
company after the merger. The board of directors of the combined company will
initially consist of seven members: Daniel C. Staton and Marc H. Bell from the
Enterprise board of directors, two members nominated by the Enterprise board,
Greg C. Mosher, Workflow's chief executive officer, and two members nominated
by Perseus, LLC, WF Capital's largest shareholder. The resulting public
company's name will be changed to Workflow Corporation.

Commenting on the proposed merger, Daniel C. Staton, Enterprise's president
and CEO, said, ""Through its long and impressive history, Workflow's management
team has developed the company into one of the leading providers of print,
promotional products and fulfillment solutions in the nation. Greg Mosher has
overseen the development of several highly successful companies over the past
30 years, many of which have Fortune 100 companies as clients. Greg is
surrounded by seasoned industry veterans, many of whom have served in senior
roles in some of the nation's largest printing, manufacturing and marketing
corporations. Through their combined expertise, Workflow has developed a
dynamic, end-to-end business platform from which clients achieve material cost
efficiencies, while receiving the highest quality product.""

Greg C. Mosher added, ""Workflow's ongoing success over the years was the
result of the technologically advanced responses to emerging needs in
promotional products, print and printed product distribution. At the core of
this success is our unique Dual Network Advantage (DNA), which integrates the
strengths of our Service Network with the efficiencies of our internal
Manufacturing Network. These two networks link our clients with proprietary,
industry-leading technology that streamlines every link in their supply chain
from bidding and procurement through production and delivery. We believe this
technology eliminates inefficiencies, enables collaboration, and connects
clients with the manufacturing and service networks. By aggregating our
clients' spend, generating new efficiencies, and managing their solutions from
end-to-end, we're creating substantial savings that go straight to the
client's bottom line.""

Acquisition Adds Core Deposits to Enhance Leading Commercial Lending,
Investment and Asset Management Business


    CHEVY CHASE, Md. and LINCOLN, Nebraska, May 17 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ --
CapitalSource Inc. (NYSE: CSE) and TierOne Corporation (Nasdaq: TONE) today
announced a definitive agreement under which CapitalSource will acquire
TierOne Corporation, the holding company of TierOne Bank, in a stock and cash
transaction valued at approximately $652 million, or approximately $34.46 for
each TierOne share.

    CapitalSource is a leading commercial lending, investment and asset
management business focused on the middle market.  As of March 31, 2007,
CapitalSource managed an $18.3 billion portfolio, including $9.5 billion in
its commercial lending and investing business, $5.6 billion in its residential
mortgage investment business and $3.0 billion managed on behalf of third
parties.

    TierOne Bank is a $3.4 billion federally chartered savings bank and the
largest publicly traded financial institution headquartered in Nebraska.
Celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2007, TierOne Bank offers customers a
wide variety of full-service consumer, commercial and agricultural banking
products and services through a network of 69 banking offices located in
Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas and nine loan production offices located in Arizona,
Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, Nevada and North Carolina.

    Upon closing of the transaction, TierOne Bank will become a subsidiary of
CapitalSource, with TierOne Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gil Lundstrom
as its Chief Executive Officer, reporting to CapitalSource's Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, John Delaney.  Lundstrom will also join
CapitalSource's Board of Directors.

    ""TierOne is a class act, a great business with great people operating in a
great market,"" said CapitalSource Chairman and CEO John Delaney.  ""Together,
we believe the two companies will deliver greater stability, higher
profitability and stronger growth.""

    ""With the acquisition of TierOne, CapitalSource achieves its long-standing
strategic objective to marry its highly profitable, growing and diverse direct
lending platform with the stability and efficiency of a well run, solid
banking franchise,"" Delaney continued.  ""CapitalSource will have both a
diversified lending platform and a truly diversified funding platform.  A rare
combination.""

    TierOne Chairman and CEO Lundstrom stated, ""The strategic partnership with
CapitalSource is a great transaction for the shareholders, customers,
communities and employees of TierOne, and will be virtually transparent.
TierOne is the cornerstone of CapitalSource's bank strategy, and the bank's
headquarters will continue to be in Lincoln, Nebraska under its existing name;
its management and employees will remain intact, and current customer products
and services, account numbers, checks, contracts and service relationships
will not change.""

    Lundstrom noted that the alliance will allow TierOne to expand its lending
capacity to better serve corporate customers through a variety of specialized
lending services.  The bank also has aggressive plans to further grow its bank
deposit gathering capabilities and loan production office network throughout
its existing market area and other economically vibrant regions throughout the
United States.

    Under the terms of the definitive agreement, which has been approved by
both companies' boards of directors, each TierOne share will be exchanged for:
(A) $6.80 in cash plus (B) 0.675 shares of CapitalSource common stock plus (C)
either: if CapitalSource's stock price, based on a 10-day trading period prior
to closing, is less than or equal to $25.1852, an additional 0.405
CapitalSource shares, or (ii) if CapitalSource's stock price, based on a 10-
day trading period prior to closing, is greater than $25.1852, at the
shareholders' election, either (a) $10.20 in cash or (b) a fraction of a
CapitalSource share having a value, based on a 10-day trading period prior to
closing, equal to $10.20.  Based on the price of CapitalSource shares at the
close of business on Thursday, May 17, 2007, the transaction is valued at
approximately $34.46 per TierOne share. The actual value on consummation of
the transaction will depend on CapitalSource's share price at closing.

    The transaction is subject to regulatory and TierOne shareholder approvals
and is expected to close in the fourth quarter 2007.

TOLEDO, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 02, 2008
Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE:HCN) has entered into an agreement
with an affiliate of Arcapita, Inc. to acquire its 90% interest in a
venture owning 29 senior housing properties managed by Sunrise Senior
Living, Inc. (NYSE:SRZ) for approximately $643.5 million, subject to
final due diligence and excluding transaction costs. Health Care
REIT's purchase will be financed with approximately $365.4 million in
cash, plus a 90% interest in the $309 million of existing debt held by
the venture. This transaction will build upon the success of Health
Care REIT's extensive relationship investment program and further
strengthen the quality of its diversified portfolio of properties.

   Sunrise Senior Living, which is widely recognized as one of the
country's leading operators of senior housing communities, will
continue to manage the properties and will retain a 10% interest in
the venture. The communities are in large, high barrier-to-entry
markets located primarily in the New York, Los Angeles and Chicago
metropolitan areas. As of June 2008, the communities, which are
predominantly Sunrise-developed mansions, had 2,082 units and an
average resident occupancy of 94%.

   ""This transaction highlights our ability to acquire premier,
consumer-focused real estate,"" commented George L. Chapman, chairman
and chief executive officer of Health Care REIT, Inc. ""We look forward
to working with Sunrise as a strategic capital partner and believe
these assets are an outstanding complement to our portfolio. The
addition of these properties will provide us an opportunity to enhance
overall NOI growth by capturing facility-level operating income in a
tax efficient manner.""

   ""We are very pleased to enter into this new venture with Health
Care REIT,"" said Paul Klaassen, Sunrise's founder and CEO. ""These 29
Sunrise communities are in deep and attractive markets. We look
forward to developing this strategic relationship with HCN, which will
allow us to continue to operate these communities and create value for
both companies.""

   Transaction Highlights

   --  Sunrise Senior Living, one of the largest senior housing
        operators in the country, will manage the portfolio for Health
        Care REIT

   --  The recently passed RIDEA legislation will allow Health Care
        REIT to more efficiently capture the benefits of both the
        property-level NOI and appreciation of the assets

   --  The properties are concentrated in top metropolitan markets,
        including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago

   --  Twenty-five of the 29 communities are Sunrise-developed
        mansions built between 1999 and 2003

   --  Twenty-eight of the 29 communities are combination facilities
        with multiple levels of care. Of the total 2,082 units, 1,393
        (67%) are assisted living; 489 (23%) are Alzheimer's care; and
        200 (10%) are independent living

   --  Property-level NOI cap rate is projected at approximately 6.6%
        based on 2009 forecasted results

   --  Per unit valuation of $343,000 is estimated to be at or below
        replacement cost

   --  The venture has $309 million of existing non-recourse mortgage
        debt, attractively priced at a current average interest rate
        of 5.2%

   --  Upon closing the transaction, the company expects its private
        pay mix across its entire portfolio of properties to exceed
        70%

   The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2008
and was not included in the company's previously announced investment
or earnings guidance. Management anticipates adjusting 2008 investment
guidance after closing the transaction. With closing anticipated in
the fourth quarter of 2008, this transaction would not impact the
company's previously issued 2008 earnings guidance. The company
believes the transaction will be breakeven to slightly accretive to
FFO beginning in 2009.

   The transaction is subject to the company's due diligence review.
The company may terminate the agreement at any time during the 45-day
review period if it is not satisfied with the results of the review.
The company's obligation to close is also subject to various other
terms and conditions.

        --  Emulex shareholders will receive a substantial premium to the
            current value of their shares and immediate value, in cash, for
            their equity stake in Emulex.
        --  Broadcom expects the acquisition of Emulex will be accretive to
            earnings per share in 2010.(1)
        --  Broadcom expects to increase both companies' revenue growth
            through an improved ability to innovate next-generation solutions
            for customers of both companies, as well as broadening the
            distribution channels for each company's products.

        --  Broadcom's cash offer will be funded from its approximately
            $2.0 billion of existing cash and marketable securities on hand,
            with the fundamentals of Broadcom's capital position remaining
            strong.

Scott A. McGregor, President and Chief Executive Officer of Broadcom, said,
""This combination is strategically compelling and provides significant value
to the shareholders of both companies. Broadcom has long and successful
experience, through over 40 transactions, of integrating companies into
Broadcom, so this is a highly achievable proposal to deliver value to
customers and employees of both companies.

""A combination of Broadcom and Emulex addresses our customers' growing need to
apply the economics of Ethernet to the Fibre Channel storage space to achieve
low-cost network converged solutions,"" Mr. McGregor added. ""The logical
evolution of the enterprise network is for a transition to a converged fabric
architecture that incorporates a broad array of technologies. Our combined
entity can be a one-stop shop for key networking and storage technologies for
the enterprise and for our industry. Our preference is to proceed in a
friendly, collaborative manner, and we hope that Emulex's Board will see the
merits of this combination and appreciate the substantial value being offered
to its shareholders.""

The combination of Broadcom and Emulex is highly complementary, with little
customer or product overlap and compatible workforces. Both companies have
highly-skilled engineering employees with expertise in different product
areas. Emulex's employees would benefit from the ability to utilize Broadcom's
vast intellectual property, engineering resources and substantial R&D scale.
Broadcom's employees would benefit from Emulex's strong position and expertise
within the storage market for host bus adapters and diversified channels.

Broadcom expects the operational integration of Broadcom and Emulex to be
highly achievable, given the complementary nature of the companies'
businesses. Both companies are headquartered in Orange County, CA.

Today, Mr. McGregor sent a letter to Emulex's Board of Directors outlining the
proposal, with the goal of moving rapidly to the negotiation and closing of a
transaction. Below is the text of the letter that Broadcom sent to Emulex's
Board of Directors:

April 21, 2009

The Board of Directors of Emulex Corporation

c/o Paul F. Folino

Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors

Emulex Corporation

3333 Susan Street

Costa Mesa, CA 92626

Dear Paul:

I am writing on behalf of the Board of Directors of Broadcom Corporation to
propose that Broadcom acquire all of the outstanding shares of Emulex common
stock for $9.25 per share, payable in cash. Our proposal is not subject to any
financing condition. We are confident that if we are given the opportunity to
engage directly with Emulex we will be able to negotiate a mutually acceptable
merger agreement, which we believe we would be able to complete expeditiously.

Significant Premium Without Risk

Our proposal provides an opportunity for Emulex shareholders to receive an
immediate and substantial cash premium that offers an attractive and highly
certain outcome for their investment. Importantly, our offer reflects a
material premium to Emulex's trading values over recent months, an attractive
premium to the April 20th closing price despite the recent run up in value,
and a significant premium to analyst estimates of shareholder value that
Emulex could expect to create on its own. Specifically, our proposal offers
Emulex shareholders the following premiums:

    --  40% to April 20th closing price
    --  62% to the average closing price for the last 30 trading days
    --  Approximately 85% to Enterprise Value*

    --  42% to the Median Analyst 12 Month Price Target

* Enterprise Value = Market Equity Value + Debt - Cash & Equivalents

Given Emulex's substantial net cash and cash equivalents balance and its
obvious contribution to your overall equity value per share, approximately
$3.46 per share, we think that your investors will find the Enterprise Value
premium we are offering, approximately 85%, particularly persuasive. Indeed,
by any relevant financial measure - premiums, trading multiples, operating
cash flow, or analyst target prices - this all-cash proposal represents a
compelling and unique opportunity for Emulex shareholders to realize
attractive value now.

Complementary Networking Solutions Create Compelling Strategic Rationale

As you know, we have believed for some time that a combination of our two
companies would benefit both companies' shareholders and the customers we
serve. With that strategic opportunity to meet the needs of the market in
mind, we sought to engage you and your Board of Directors in discussions in
late December regarding a potential combination of Emulex with Broadcom. We
were disappointed when, in early January, you responded that the company was
not for sale and abruptly cut off the possibility of further discussions. Even
more troubling was the fact that merely one week after that communication, you
took actions clearly designed to thwart the ability of your shareholders to
receive a premium for their shares. These included adopting a ""poison-pill""
and amending your bylaws. It is difficult for us to understand why Emulex's
Board of Directors has not been open to consideration of a combination of our
respective companies. We would much prefer to have engaged in mutual and
constructive discussions with you. However this opportunity is in our view so
compelling we now feel we must share our proposal publicly with your
shareholders.

Our proposal to combine Broadcom and Emulex will not only provide significant
benefits to Emulex shareholders, but also to Emulex's customers, many of whom
we share in common. The architecture of data centers is evolving rapidly, and
customers' desire for system consolidation is driving the need for converged
networking solutions where multiple traffic types - such as network, storage
and clustering - are all carried over a single network infrastructure. These
converged networking solutions promise to enable end users to reduce the
overall number of NICs, cables and switch ports required to run their
networks, which in turn lowers overall costs, power and cooling requirements,
and reduces the time and expense spent supporting and maintaining multiple
distinct networks. In the future, the convergence of Fibre Channel and
Ethernet ""FCoE"" will be offered through a single chip solution inside Servers
and Switches. Customers will demand from their suppliers advanced chip
technology and supply chain scale and reliability which is not an area of
strength for Emulex. Broadcom brings tremendous value in advanced chip
technology and supply chain scale and reliability to Emulex's products - and
customers.

If we seize the opportunity to combine Broadcom's deep expertise and
leadership in Ethernet networking and fabless SoC development with Emulex's
similarly impressive expertise and leadership in Fibre Channel storage
networking these complementary strengths will enable our combined company to
accelerate the development and adoption of the converged networking solutions
that represent the future.

Enhances Ability to Innovate and Encourage Product Development

In addition to the development of exciting new converged networking solutions,
there are substantial opportunities for this transaction to strengthen
Emulex's existing businesses given our complementary customer profiles and the
potential to enhance operational and supply chain scale. We believe the
proposed combination would enable us to offer our customers a more complete
product portfolio, while enabling Emulex to penetrate business segments where
it has historically underperformed. We are particularly excited by the value
our combined company will bring to the growing blade server segment, in which
Broadcom has a demonstrated track record of innovation and reliable supply to
many of the leading OEMs. The combination also will allow us to dedicate more
resources to product development and customer support than either company
could do separately.

In short, we are confident the innovative integration of our respective
technical capabilities will be a winning proposition for our customers -
driving a broader set of offerings for the customers of both companies,
including better support, lower costs and higher performance solutions.

Just as our combination will offer exciting and tangible benefits for
customers, we also believe that a combination will be a rewarding opportunity
for Emulex's employees. We have a great deal of respect for the technical
achievements of the Emulex team, and believe the continued motivation and
productivity of Emulex's employees is critical to our combined success.
Broadcom has a culture rich in innovation, high quality execution, and a
willingness to invest aggressively in the development of new technologies -
all of which spell opportunity for the employees of a combined company to do
great things. In addition, because our companies' respective headquarters are
located only a few miles from each other in Orange County, California, we hope
and expect that we will be able to integrate our teams rapidly and foster a
high degree of collaboration and interaction from the very start. It would be
our clear intent to strive for continued technological leadership and superior
customer service after our two companies are combined.

To move forward quickly, we have retained Banc of America Securities as our
financial advisor and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP as our legal
advisor, which, alongside our senior management team, have already completed
extensive analysis and due diligence based on publicly available information.
Broadcom has a well-established record as an acquiror, having completed more
than forty such transactions over the past decade.

We understand your role as directors and your responsibility to act in the
best interests of the Emulex shareholders in reviewing and making a
recommendation with respect to our proposal and hope you will not take any
further actions that would destroy shareholder value or otherwise impede your
shareholders' ability to approve and consummate a transaction. To that end, we
are today commencing an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against
Emulex and its Board of Directors to declare invalid that portion of Section
6.4 of Emulex's recently amended Bylaws that imposes the requirement that the
Bylaws may not be altered, amended or repealed by the stockholders without the
vote or written consent of 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares. We will also ask
the Court of Chancery to enjoin enforcement of that provision as well as any
improper actions to impede this proposal or Broadcom's efforts to acquire
control of Emulex.

Of course, our strong preference would be to proceed in a friendly,
constructive way to make this exceptional opportunity a reality as soon as
possible. After you have had a chance to consider our proposal with your
advisors, we would welcome the opportunity to discuss it with you. But please
note that regardless of whether you engage with us, we are prepared to submit
our proposal directly to Emulex's stockholders for their approval.

This matter has the highest priority for Broadcom. I look forward to a
positive response from you shortly.

Sincerely yours,

Scott A. McGregor

President and Chief Executive Officer

By Matt Jarzemsky
     Sept. 15 (Bloomberg) -- Axcelis Technologies Inc., the
maker of chip-making equipment, lost 66 percent of its market
value in Nasdaq trading after saying Tokyo-based Sumitomo Heavy
Industries Ltd. wouldn't make a third bid to buy it. The plunge
was the biggest in eight years.
     The aborted takeover ``has added substantially to Axcelis'
challenges,'' including efforts to refinance convertible debt
due in January 2009, Axcelis said today in a regulatory filing.
The company issued $75 million in convertible senior
subordinated notes in 2006 to generate $24.2 million in working
capital and retire $50.8 million in debt, according to a
statement at the time.
     ``The stock has been largely supported by the Sumitomo
bid,'' Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg said in a
telephone interview. ``They have to figure out how to raise some
cash to cover the debt that comes due in January.''
     The U.S. company proposed to borrow from SEN Corp., its
joint venture with Sumitomo Heavy, which has a cash balance of
$120 million, Axcelis said today in a regulatory filing.
Sumitomo Heavy rejected the plan and ``offered a small loan from
SEN which was conditioned'' on Sumitomo's ``taking control'' of
the joint venture, Axcelis said.
     Axcelis sank $2.81 to $1.43 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading, the steepest tumble since
July 2000 and the biggest loss today on the Russell 2000 Index.
     M. Lin-Hua Wu, a spokeswoman for Axcelis who works for
Kekst & Co., said the company had no comment beyond its filing.
     The two manufacturers began ``confidential discussions'' on
the buyout in June, according to the filing, after Axcelis
rejected two earlier bids by Sumitomo Heavy and private equity
partner TPG Capital.

                        49 Percent Premium

     An initial offer of $5.20 a share, or $544 million, on Feb.
11 was increased to $6, or $630 million, on March 10. The
revised proposal was 49 percent greater than the stock's price
on Feb. 8, the last trading day before Sumitomo Heavy, Japan's
largest maker of plastic injection-molding equipment, began its
takeover attempt.
     Both bids undervalued the company, Axcelis said. Axcelis's
revenue in the second quarter declined 38 percent from its peak
in the fourth period of 2006. The company recorded losses in the
past four quarters.
     ``It's unlikely there are any other bidders coming in and
now you have to look at the company's fundamentals,'' said
Twigg, who's based in Portland, Oregon, and rates the shares
``sector perform.'' ``They need the semiconductor market to turn
around.''
     Axcelis shares have fallen 70 percent this year. Sumitomo
Heavy rose 8.7 percent to 510 yen in Tokyo trading on Sept. 12.

By Sharon Smyth and Peter Woodifield
     June 18 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
world's largest securities firm, and its partner bid 782.4
million euros ($1.05 billion) for two Italian real estate funds,
trumping an offer by Morgan Stanley, the second-largest
securities firm, and Pirelli & C. Real Estate SpA.
     Goldman's Whitehall real estate funds and Union Generale
Immobiliare, a company controlled by Italian businessman
Francesco Caltagirone, offered 650 euros per unit for both
Berenice Fondo Uffici and Tecla Fondo Uffici, Whitehall said in
a statement today. Pirelli, which manages both funds, and Morgan
Stanley bid 590 euros per Tecla unit and 540 euros for each
Berenice fund unit in May.
     Whitehall and UGI said they plan to use the funds as a
platform for expanding in the Italian real estate market.
Italian commercial real estate returned 8 percent in 2006, in
line with returns in three of the last four years, according to
Investment Property Databank Ltd., a London-based researcher.
     The price offered by Whitehall and UGI for Berenice is 20
percent higher than the bid by Gamma Re, Morgan Stanley and
Pirelli Re's bidding company, and 37 percent more than the
average price of the fund in the 12 months to May 18, said
Whitehall. The Tecla offer by Whitehall and UGI is 10 percent
more than the Morgan Stanley, Pirelli offer and 23 percent
higher than the average share price over the same period.

                        Acceptance Period

     Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, Cristina Fossati,
a spokeswoman for Pirelli Re, and Lucas Van Praag, a spokesman
for Goldman, weren't immediately available for comment.
     The Tecla and Berenice funds are listed on the Milan
exchange. The acceptance period of the offers, to be decided by
the Italian exchange, will probably be between July and the
first two weeks of August, Whitehall and UGI said.
     The offer by Goldman and UGI values Berenice at 412 million
euros and Tecla at 370 million euros.
     Whitehall will own a majority stake in Zwinger Opco 6 BV,
the joint venture's bidding company, according to the statement.
     Goldman, Sachs & Co. will act as financial adviser to
Whitehall on the transaction, the statement said. BNP Paribas and
MPS Finance Banca Mobiliare, will co-ordinate the collection of
the units. Giliberti Pappalettera Triscornia e Associati, Shearman
& Sterling and Cifford Chance LLP will act as legal advisers.
     Units of Tecla gained 60 euros, or 10 percent, to 650 euros
at 5:17 p.m. in Milan. Berenice's stock climbed 110 euros, or 20
percent, to 650 euros.

  Consumer Products Business to 3M for $550 Million

Business Wire

PASADENA, Calif. -- January 03, 2012

Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE:AVY) today announced that it has signed a
definitive agreement to sell its Office and Consumer Products business (OCP)
to 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) for $550 million in cash. The transaction is subject
to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

The sale of our Office and Consumer Products business to 3M presents the best
opportunity to maximize OCPs value for Avery Dennisons shareholders, and
complements 3Ms global portfolio, said Dean A. Scarborough, Avery Dennison
chairman, president and chief executive officer. Our industry-leading
Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions
businesses, combined with our strong balance sheet, make us well positioned
for profitable growth and increased return of cash to shareholders.

Avery Dennison intends to use the proceeds from the transaction primarily to
reduce debt, make additional pension contributions, and repurchase shares.
This transaction will not negatively impact the Companys common stock
dividend.

Avery Dennisons Office and Consumer Products business is one of the worlds
leading suppliers of printable media and other products, with expected sales
in 2011 of approximately $765 million; and expected adjusted operating income
and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) in
2011 of approximately $80 million and $95 million, respectively. These
adjusted operating income and EBITDA estimates exclude allocations of general
corporate overhead. To reduce costs, and in anticipation of an OCP
transaction, Avery Dennison began implementing cost reduction actions as
described in the Companys third quarter 2011 Form 10-Q.

Avery Dennison Corporations pro forma sales in 2011, excluding OCP, are
expected to be approximately $6 billion. All expectations herein of the
performance of OCP and Avery Dennison are as of October 26, 2011, the date
that the Company announced its third quarter 2011 results.

The transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2012.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC advised Avery Dennison on the transaction. Latham &
Watkins served as Avery Dennisons legal counsel.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted Operating Income for OCP refers to segment operating income before
interest, taxes, restructuring charges, general overhead allocations and
transaction costs.

EBITDA for OCP refers to Adjusted Operating Income before depreciation and
amortization.

Avery Dennison's pro forma sales refers to net sales excluding OCP sales,
adjusted for the positive impact on net sales from the change from
intercompany supply of pressure-sensitive materials to agreed-upon supply of
such materials to 3M.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a
substitute for, the comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial
measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic
decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions,
which are included in the GAAP financial measures, may make it difficult to
assess the transaction. By excluding certain accounting effects, both positive
and negative, from certain of our GAAP financial measures, we believe that we
are providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an
understanding of the transaction. These non-GAAP financial measures are used
internally to evaluate trends in our underlying business, as well as to
facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period. While
some of the items we exclude from GAAP financial measures may recur, they tend
to be disparate in amount, frequency, and timing.

Comtech Telecommunications to pay $16.40 per share

CPI cancels previously scheduled earnings call

  PR Newswire

  PALO ALTO, Calif., May 10

PALO ALTO, Calif., May 10 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- CPI International, Inc.
(Nasdaq: CPII) announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement with
Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (Nasdaq: CMTL) under which Comtech will
purchase CPI in a cash and stock transaction with an enterprise value of
approximately $472.3 million.  Comtech will fund the acquisition by
redeploying approximately $372.0 million of its existing cash plus the
issuance of approximately 4.4 million shares of Comtech common stock.  All
existing CPI debt is anticipated to be repaid upon the closing of the
transaction.

(Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20060426/CPILOGO)

Based on the May 7, 2010 closing price of Comtech stock which was $31.06, CPI
shareholders will receive a combination of cash and stock that is currently
valued at approximately $16.40 per CPI common share.  This amount represents a
premium of 25.7 percent as compared to the last closing price of CPI common
stock and 21.3 percent as compared to the last 30 trading day average closing
price.

The ultimate amount of consideration that a CPI shareholder will receive will
be equal to a combination of $9.00 in cash plus a fraction of Comtech common
stock equal to $8.10 divided by the average closing price of Comtech common
stock over a specified period of time prior to closing, provided that the
fraction shall not be greater than 0.2382 nor less than 0.2132.  Based on the
May 7, 2010 closing price of Comtech stock which was $31.06, the fraction was
equal to 0.2382 and was currently valued at $7.40 per CPI share.

Joe Caldarelli, Chief Executive Officer of CPI, said, ""The Board of Directors
and management believe this strategic combination with Comtech is compelling
and provides significant benefits for shareholders, customers and our
employees.  CPI shareholders will benefit from an immediate premium while
sharing in the future growth of the combined companies.  Furthermore, our
customers will benefit from greater resources and more diverse product
offerings, and our employees will benefit from being part of a larger more
diversified company.""

Fred Kornberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of Comtech, said, ""We are
excited to have reached this agreement with CPI and believe this combination
is beneficial to the stakeholders of both companies.  CPI is a unique business
and a leading global supplier of vacuum electron devices which are used in
hundreds of critical commercial and military applications.  The acquisition is
a significant step in our strategy of developing a one-stop shopping approach
for RF microwave products.  The combination will allow us to unite our
companies' resources to develop and bring new and innovative products to
market and to our customers.  We welcome CPI's talented workforce to the
Comtech team and are excited about the future.""

Mr. Kornberg and Mr. Caldarelli jointly stated, ""We intend to thoughtfully and
actively address our customers' needs as we integrate our complementary and
diverse product lines.  We plan no interruptions in any scheduled or committed
rollouts from either company, and we intend to continue to support all
existing Comtech and CPI products and services.  We anticipate honoring all
existing agreements with customers, VARs, distributors, OEMs and other
strategic partners.""

CPI's senior executive management and corporate team are expected to stay in
their current or similar roles and will work directly with Comtech management
after the transaction closes.

Closing Conditions and Shareholder Voting Requirements

The transaction is subject to a number of customary regulatory and other
closing conditions.  The transaction is not subject to approval by Comtech
shareholders nor is it subject to any financing conditions.  The transaction
is subject to CPI shareholder approval.

The Cypress Group and related entities, which currently own approximately 53
percent of the outstanding common stock of CPI, have entered into a voting
agreement, subject to its terms and conditions, to demonstrate their strong
support of the proposed transaction.

    CORAL GABLES, Fla., Feb. 7 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- MBF Healthcare
Acquisition Corp. (Amex: MBH), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition
company, announced today that it has signed a definitive stock purchase
agreement with Critical Homecare Solutions Holdings, Inc. (along with its
subsidiaries, ""CHS"").  Privately-owned CHS is a leading provider of
comprehensive home infusion therapy and specialty infusion services, based in
Conshohoken, Pennsylvania.  The boards of directors of both companies have
unanimously approved the transaction.

    The home infusion industry is estimated to be approximately a $5 billion
market, growing at approximately seven percent per year due to constructive
cost setting for payers, a favorable reimbursement environment, and positive
demographic trends.  The market is largely fragmented with the top four home
care infusion companies, which includes CHS, representing 25 percent of the
market, with the remaining 75 percent represented by smaller local and
regional companies.  This combination of macro drivers and market
fragmentation presents a favorable dynamic for growth through acquisitions as
well as organically.  CHS is also well positioned to take advantage of the 400
new specialty infused drugs currently in the pipeline from pharmaceutical
manufacturers.

    For the three month period ended December 31, 2007, CHS generated an
annual run rate of adjusted revenues and adjusted earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") of approximately $218 million
and $43 million, respectively. CHS maintains a healthy pipeline of acquisition
targets and expects to continue its acquisition strategy of acquiring four to
six companies per year.

    Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, MBH will acquire all of the
outstanding capital stock of CHS, a Kohlberg & Co., LLC portfolio company, for
$420 million, subject to customary adjustments as set forth in the stock
purchase agreement.  Upon completion of the acquisition, MBH will change its
name to Critical Homecare Solutions, Inc., and expects its common stock to
continue trading publicly on the American Stock Exchange.

    MBH intends to fund the purchase price and the acquisition costs and
provide additional capital to CHS for growth and expansion through a
combination of approximately $180 million of cash in its trust account,
approximately $180 million of debt provided by Jefferies Finance LLC, a $35
million equity issuance of MBH common stock to Kohlberg & Co., LLC, other
stockholders of CHS and certain senior members of CHS management, and a
commitment from MBF Healthcare Partners, L.P. to acquire up to an additional
$50 million in shares of MBH common stock.  The shares of MBH common stock to
be issued to Kohlberg & Co., LLC, other stockholders of CHS and certain senior
members of CHS management and the shares that are subject to the commitment
from MBF Healthcare Partners, L.P. will be priced at the closing per share
price of MBH common stock on February 6, 2008, which was $7.65.

    The closing of the acquisition and the issuance of equity to MBF
Healthcare Partners, L.P. pursuant to its commitment are subject to MBH
stockholder approval and other customary closing conditions.  In addition, the
closing of the acquisition is conditioned on holders of less than 30% of the
shares of MBH common stock issued in its initial public offering voting
against the acquisition and electing to convert their MBH common stock into
cash, as permitted by the company's Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation. Assuming the transactions receive requisite stockholder
approval and all other conditions are met, MBH anticipates completing the
acquisition of CHS in the second or third quarter of 2008.

    The combined company will be led by CHS's President and Chief Executive
Officer Robert Cucuel, a seasoned homecare executive. Mr. Cucuel was
previously President and CEO of Air Products Healthcare and a founder,
President and CEO of American Homecare Supply.  Mr. Cucuel and his management
team have been consolidating homecare companies for the last 12 years and have
integrated over 60 acquisitions during that time.  Since its founding in 2006,
CHS has acquired and integrated eight acquisitions, making it a leading
consolidator of independents in the sector.

    Mr. Cucuel said, ""We are very pleased with the attention received by MBF
Healthcare Acquisition Corp. as they recognized the value of our business, our
acquisition track record and the opportunities for consolidation in the home
infusion industry.  The transaction with MBF meets our goal of becoming a
publicly traded company.  We are well positioned to continue our growth
strategy that in less than two years has enabled us to become one of the
largest providers of home infusion therapy and specialty infusion services.""

    Mike B. Fernandez, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MBH, commented,
""We promised our investors that we would acquire a healthcare services company
that is a market leader in its industry, with positive EBITDA, a strong
management team and a platform well positioned to take advantage of market
opportunities, and that is exactly what we have done.  Critical Homecare
Solutions Holdings, Inc. has become a leader in consolidating a very
fragmented home infusion industry and the company is very well positioned to
benefit from the extensive pipeline of infused specialty drugs.  Robert and
his team have proven throughout their careers, and since the inception of CHS,
that they can grow and integrate companies.  The growth experienced by CHS in
less than two years is very impressive and we will make sure that we continue
to support its growth.  We look forward to working with Robert and his team in
achieving their goal of making CHS the largest home infusion company in the
United States.""

Phase III MOZOBIL complements Millennium's market-leading VELCADE and enhances
patient eligibility for potentially life-saving stem cell transplants


    CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Millennium
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: MLNM) today announced it has entered into an
agreement to acquire AnorMED, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANOR; TSX: AOM), a Canadian-based
biopharmaceutical company with a late-stage Phase III hematology-oncology
product, MOZOBIL.  Under the terms of the agreement approved by the boards of
directors of both companies and the largest shareholder of AnorMED, Millennium
will commence within ten days a cash tender offer to acquire the shares of
AnorMED stock at a price of U.S. $12.00 per outstanding share, for a total
purchase price of approximately $515 million.  This represents approximately a
21 percent premium over the closing price of AnorMED's shares on September 25,
2006.

    (Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/19991220/MLNMLOGO )

    MOZOBIL, currently in late-stage Phase III clinical development, is
anticipated to be launched in the U.S. in 2008 subject to successful
completion of clinical trials and regulatory approval.  MOZOBIL, a small
molecule CXCR4 chemokine antagonist, works by releasing stem cells from the
bone marrow into circulation, improving the ability to collect the stem cells
for transplant.  Stem-cell transplants offer a potential cure for patients
with certain hematological malignancies. Currently, a majority of the 50,000
to 60,000 transplant-eligible patients worldwide are unable to optimize the
benefit of transplant due to sub-optimal stem-cell collection.

    Assuming the acquisition is completed and MOZOBIL is approved, the product
would be sold by Millennium's oncology sales force, which currently details
VELCADE(R) (bortezomib) for Injection, the market leader in relapsed multiple
myeloma.

    ""MOZOBIL is an excellent strategic fit with Millennium's focus in
hematology-oncology, where our product VELCADE leads the market in treating
patients with relapsed multiple myeloma,"" said Deborah Dunsire, M.D.,
President and Chief Executive Officer, Millennium. ""This proposed acquisition
is aligned with our goal to bring in products that accelerate revenue growth,
leverage our oncology sales infrastructure and benefit from our development,
regulatory and commercial expertise. We are extremely excited to carry forward
the innovative work of the AnorMED team and to improve outcomes for
transplant-eligible patients by bringing MOZOBIL to market.""


    Strong Clinical Progress for MOZOBIL

    In the September 2005 issue of Blood, Neal Flomenberg, M.D., et al.,
reported that in a Phase II clinical trial, 60 percent of patients who
received MOZOBIL in combination with the current standard of care for
stem-cell mobilization, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF),
collected the optimal target number of cells for transplant in two apheresis
days, compared to only 16 percent of patients who received G-CSF alone.  The
cell yield in patients on MOZOBIL in combination with G-CSF was on average 290
percent higher compared to the cell yield in patients on G-CSF alone.
The two ongoing randomized, double-blinded Phase III trials, designed under
the special protocol assessment process with the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), are exploring MOZOBIL with G-CSF compared to placebo with G-CSF in
multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients.  Patient
enrollment was completed in the Phase III multiple myeloma trial in July 2006
and, as of September 15, 2006, 92 percent of patients in the Phase III NHL
trial had been enrolled with total enrollment expected to be completed by the
end of 2006.  Data from these registration-enabling trials are expected in
2007.

    Based on preclinical data, MOZOBIL may also render patients with certain
hematological diseases more responsive to chemotherapy, including patients
with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).


    Post-Acquisition Integration

    If this transaction is completed, Millennium believes AnorMED would
strengthen Millennium's foundation in building a leading biopharmaceutical
company in oncology and inflammation.  The assets of the combined companies
would consist of:


    * VELCADE - A first-in-class, market-leading product which provides an
      unmatched survival advantage to relapsed multiple myeloma patients.
      Millennium was recently granted priority review with a PDUFA date of
      December 9, 2006 by the FDA for its supplementary new drug application
      covering VELCADE for relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.  Phase III trials
      are ongoing in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients and relapsed
      follicular and marginal zone lymphoma patients.  Over 300 trials are
      ongoing or planned to explore the potential of VELCADE in other cancers.

    * MOZOBIL - A first-in-class, late-stage Phase III molecule for stem-cell
      transplant in multiple myeloma and NHL with a planned U.S. launch in
      2008.  MOZOBIL has additional potential in chemosensitization for
      hematological diseases including AML and CLL.

    * Novel development pipeline - A pipeline of nine oncology and
      inflammation molecules in clinical development and late-stage
      preclinical development, in addition to VELCADE and MOZOBIL.

    * Innovative discovery organization - An oncology-focused discovery
      organization with expertise in protein homeostasis, signal transduction
      and cell-surface targets.  In the past three years, six Millennium
      discovered molecules have progressed to the development pipeline.

    * Collaborations - Millennium is engaged in several strategic alliances
      which provide significant revenues to Millennium through royalties on
      product sales, milestone payments and reimbursements.  Alliances
      include an ex-U.S. commercialization and global development agreement
      with Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C.
      (J&JPRD) for VELCADE, a development and commercialization agreement
      with sanofi-aventis for anti-inflammatory small molecules and a
      royalty-based agreement with Schering-Plough Corporation for the
      marketed-product INTEGRILIN(R) (eptifibatide) Injection.

    * Post-acquisition integration plans are underway and will be announced at
      the closing of the transaction.  The focus of the integration is to
      accelerate filing and launch of MOZOBIL.  The transaction is expected
      to be modestly accretive to Millennium in 2008 and significantly
      accretive in 2009 and beyond assuming successful commercial launch of
      MOZOBIL in 2008.

    Transaction Summary

    Millennium's acquisition of AnorMED would take the form of an all cash
tender offer to acquire all of AnorMED's outstanding shares at the price of
U.S. $12.00 per share for a total amount of approximately U.S. $515 million.
Millennium's tender offer will commence within 10 days and is expected to be
open for at least 35 days. The boards of directors of both companies have
approved the transaction.  Several investment partnerships managed by Baker
Brothers Advisors,  L.L.C. and its affiliates have also entered into an
agreement to tender their shares under the bid.  Previously, AnorMED rejected
an unsolicited offer by Genzyme Corporation, announced September 1, 2006, at
U.S. $8.55 per share. In the event that the transaction between Millennium and
AnorMED does not close successfully, Millennium would under certain
circumstances be entitled to a termination fee of $19.5 million.

    J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. acted as Millennium's financial advisor and
provided a fairness opinion to Millennium's board of directors.  Morgan
Stanley also provided advisory services to Millennium on this transaction.

Company signs agreement to acquire approximately 50,000 net acres in Bradford
County, PA

  PR Newswire

  HOUSTON, Nov. 15, 2010

HOUSTON, Nov. 15, 2010 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Newfield Exploration Company
(NYSE: NFX) today announced the signing of a purchase and sale agreement with
EOG Resources, Inc., for approximately 50,000 net acres in the Marcellus
Shale. Substantially all the acreage is located in Bradford County,
Pennsylvania, in the Susquehanna River Basin. This transaction, valued at $405
million, will more than double Newfield's current acreage position in the
Marcellus Shale and will provide a deep inventory of future development
drilling locations. The closing is expected before year-end 2010 and is
subject to customary terms and conditions.

Newfield plans to finance the transaction under the Company's revolving credit
facility (an undrawn $1.25 billion facility). Longer term, borrowings under
the credit facility would be reduced with proceeds from the sale of certain
non-strategic assets.

Gross production from the properties is approximately 7 MMcf/d from five
wells. There is an inventory of 11 uncompleted wells and plans to drill 10
additional wells by year-end 2010. Current gathering capacity is 25 MMcf/d
with capability to expand to 95 MMcf/d in early 2011.  Newfield estimates that
more than 400 gross operated well locations exist on the acreage and that net
unrisked reserve potential is 1.5  2.0 Tcfe.

Newfield plans to run two operated rigs and invest approximately $100 million
in 2011 to substantially hold the acreage by production. The Company plans to
defer exploratory drilling in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in 2011, allowing
for a re-allocation of approximately $70 million to its Appalachian
development program. Net production in 2011 from the acquired Marcellus
properties is expected to exceed the production associated with the
non-strategic assets planned for divestment in 2011.

""This transaction doubles our footprint in the Marcellus and adds core acreage
with attractive development drilling opportunities,"" said Lee K. Boothby,
Newfield Chairman, President and CEO. ""This Marcellus acreage is high-quality
and has a low cost structure. It will complement our portfolio of oil assets
and provide us with greater flexibility in future commodity price cycles. The
deal is consistent with our strategy of building a business in the Appalachian
region, just as we have done in the Mid-Continent and the Rocky Mountains. The
acreage is contiguous and has a gathering system in place that will allow us
to access markets and grow production.""

Newfield entered the Appalachian Region in October 2009 and assembled a team
of professionals with experience in assessing and developing resource plays.
The Company's initial entry into the region came through a joint venture with
Hess Corporation covering approximately 70,000 gross acres primarily in Wayne
County, Pennsylvania. The partnership has drilled three exploratory wells in
Wayne County to date. Newfield operates the venture with a 50 percent
interest.

Newfield Exploration Company is an independent crude oil and natural gas
exploration and production company. The Company relies on a proven growth
strategy of growing reserves through an active drilling program and select
acquisitions. Newfield's domestic areas of operation include the
Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains, onshore Texas, Appalachia and the Gulf of
Mexico. The Company has international operations in Malaysia and China.

This release contains forward-looking information. All information other than
historical facts included in this release, such as information regarding
estimated or anticipated drilling plans, capital expenditures and asset sales,
is forward-looking information. Although Newfield believes that these
expectations are reasonable, this information is based upon assumptions and
anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks.
Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many
factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions,
the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other
support services, the availability of refining capacity for the crude oil
Newfield produces from its Monument Butte field in Utah, the availability and
cost of capital resources, labor conditions and severe weather conditions
(such as hurricanes). In addition, the drilling of oil and gas wells and the
production of hydrocarbons are subject to governmental regulations and
operating risks.

DALLAS -- February 27, 2012

Kosmos Energy (NYSE: KOS) announced today that it has exercised a right under
the existing Joint Operating Agreement to acquire the participating interest
of Sabre Oil & Gas Holdings Limited in the Deepwater Tano Block, offshore
Ghana. The purchase price is estimated to be approximately $365 million, with
up to an additional $45 million contingent upon achieving certain performance
milestones. Following closing of the acquisition, Kosmos interest in the
Deepwater Tano Block will increase from 18 percent to 22.05 percent. Kosmos
interest in the Jubilee Field will increase from 24.1 percent to 25.8 percent.

Brian F. Maxted, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, We feel very
fortunate to have an opportunity to grow our interest in what we believe are
some of the most valuable assets in West Africa at a compelling price. This
transaction adds existing production at Jubilee, enhances our stake in the
next oil development offshore Ghana, and increases our exposure to the
significant Deepwater Tano exploration program in 2012. We have great belief
and confidence in the quality, value, and upside of our discoveries and the
further potential of the Tano basin petroleum system.

Closing of the transaction should occur in the second quarter of 2012, subject
to a definitive transaction agreement, customary closing conditions and
necessary government approvals. The Company anticipates funding the purchase
price through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings. The effective date
of the acquisition is January 1, 2012.

  per Share

   Proposal Follows Refusal of JAKKS Board to Consider Actions to Maximize
                              Shareholder Value

Business Wire

LOS ANGELES -- September 14, 2011

Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (Oaktree) today announced that certain
funds and accounts that it manages (Oaktree Funds) have made a proposal to
acquire all outstanding shares of JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (NASDAQ: JAKK) (JAKKS
or the Company) common stock for $20.00 per share in cash, representing a
total equity value of approximately $670 million on a fully diluted basis. The
offer represents a 25% premium over the Companys closing stock price as of
September 13, the 30-day average closing price of the Companys stock leading
up to September 13, and the average closing price of the Companys stock over
the preceding 24 months.

The Oaktree Funds are making the proposal public after the JAKKS Boards
continued refusal to engage in meaningful discussions about the options
available for maximizing shareholder value at JAKKS, including an acquisition
by the Oaktree Funds. The Oaktree Funds are among JAKKS largest shareholders,
with a current collective stake of approximately 4.9% of JAKKS common shares.

Below is the text of the most recent letter Oaktree sent to JAKKS Board of
Directors outlining its proposal:

September 13, 2011
 
The Board of Directors of JAKKS Pacific, Inc.
22619 Pacific Coast Highway
Malibu, CA 90265
Attention: Stephen G. Berman and Murray L. Skala
 

Gentlemen:

We are disappointed that you have repeatedly declined to pursue meaningful
discussions with us about the options available for maximizing shareholder
value at JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKKS or the Company), including a potential
going-private transaction. Collectively, Oaktree-managed funds (Oaktree
Funds) are among the Companys largest shareholders, with a stake of
approximately 4.9% of outstanding common shares, and we are strong believers
in the potential for long-term value creation at JAKKS. As such, it has been
our preference to discuss with you available options to enhance shareholder
value, including a potential negotiated going-private transaction. We have
attempted to engage with you on that basis since March of this year, but you
have repeatedly rebuffed our efforts. Given the significant ownership interest
that the Oaktree Funds have in JAKKS, we are left with no acceptable
alternative but to make it known publicly that we are prepared to acquire,
through the Oaktree Funds, all of the Companys outstanding common shares for
$20.00 per share in cash. We also believe it is important for fellow
shareholders to know that our funds are willing to increase the price of this
offer if the Company can demonstrate to us further value over the course of
our due diligence process.

Since the time of our initial discussions in March, macro-economic conditions
have deteriorated significantly, and the Companys prospects have not
improved. As a result, we strongly believe that JAKKS shareholders would
welcome the certainty of a significant all-cash premium for their shares.

Our funds have acquired a 4.9% position in JAKKS because we believe that the
shares are undervalued. We would like to engage in a dialogue with you about
options available to enhance shareholder value, including a conversation about
a potential going private transaction at $20.00 per share.

A going-private transaction at $20.00 per share delivers fair and compelling
value to JAKKS shareholders and represents a 25% premium over the Companys
closing stock price as of September 13, the 30-day average closing price of
the Companys stock leading up to September 13, and the average closing price
of the Companys stock over the preceding 24 months. Importantly, in view of
the Companys substantial cash position, which by our calculation amounts to
approximately $7.38 per share, on a fully diluted basis, our proposal on a
cash-adjusted basis represents a premium of 46% over the Companys
cash-adjusted closing stock price as of September 13. The Oaktree Funds
proposal creates immediate liquidity for JAKKS shareholders, an opportunity
not otherwise available to them in the highly illiquid trading market for the
Companys stock.

As we indicated in March, the Oaktree Funds are prepared to commit substantial
capital resources to the Company, in the form of both debt and equity to help
fund future acquisitions, new licenses and an aggressive organic growth
strategy. We continue to believe that the Company, its licensors and its
employees would benefit greatly in the long run from private ownership of
JAKKS, which would enable the Company to execute a long-term value creation
strategy free from the pressures of managing short-term objectives and
seasonality.

This transaction is of the highest priority for us and has the full attention
of our investment team and legal advisors at Kirkland & Ellis LLP. We are
ready to proceed immediately and, with the Companys full cooperation, we
believe we can complete our due diligence, have firm committed financing and
execute definitive documentation within 60 days. The Oaktree Funds have
long-standing relationships with lenders who have substantial experience in
the Companys industry. We are highly confident in our ability to raise the
necessary debt financing for the transaction.

While we remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement that benefits all JAKKS
shareholders, we are committed to maximizing the value of our investment and,
consequently, are prepared to take our offer directly to JAKKS shareholders
should the need arise.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.
As Investment Manager to certain funds and accounts

   Gilat Shareholders to Receive $11.40 per Share


PETAH TIKVA, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 31, 2008
Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (""Gilat"") (NASDAQ and Tel Aviv Stock

Officer of Gilat, said, ""We believe that this acquisition presents our
shareholders, customers, employees and partners with an exciting
opportunity. Our Board of Directors has always focused on long term
shareholder value. In the last eleven months, we have evaluated our
strategy going forward and after careful and thorough analysis, and
with the completion of extensive negotiations with the buyers, the
Board of Directors has decided to endorse this transaction as being in
the best interest of our shareholders and recommends that it be
approved by them. We believe that this transaction recognizes the
value of Gilat's strong market position and product portfolio, while
providing our shareholders with an attractive cash offer. As we move
from a public to a private company, I remain committed to the Company
and its long term growth strategy. Our success is driven by the hard
work, commitment and dedication of our capable employees around the
world and I thank them for their invaluable contribution to Gilat.""

   Scott Honour, Senior Managing Director of The Gores Group, said,

including in the government defense sector in the United States and
international markets.""

*T

--  Adds scale with increased presence in attractive SOC test market


--  Combines highly complementary products, markets, customers and
    channels


--  Expects annualized synergies of at least $25 million, following the
    completion of the integration

*T


Verigy (NASDAQ: VRGY) and LTX-Credence Corporation (NASDAQ: LTXC) today
announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement
that would create a semiconductor test company with the scale and
presence to provide comprehensive solutions to customers across most
major semiconductor market segments. The combined company, to be
called Verigy, will feature a portfolio of leading semiconductor test
systems consisting of innovative and cost-optimized test platforms
that address the broad, divergent requirements of the wireless,
graphics, computing, automotive, industrial, and entertainment
markets.

With an expanded product portfolio, strong share position in target
segments and large support network through a direct support team and
key strategic partners such as Spirox in Taiwan and China, the new
Verigy expects to be well-positioned to deliver significant value to
customers, shareholders and employees. By combining two of the
industry's most highly skilled and experienced R&D teams under a
common focus and direction, Verigy anticipates creating a stronger,
more competitive innovator of test cell solutions that enable
semiconductor manufacturers to meet time-to-market and cost-of-test
demands.

Verigy president and COO, Jorge Titinger, and LTX-Credence president
and CEO, David Tacelli, will serve as co-CEOs of the new company,
which will be headquartered in Singapore with U.S. headquarters in
Cupertino, California. Verigy chairman and CEO, Keith Barnes, will
continue as the chairman of the board of directors, which will be
comprised of 12 members, seven designated by Verigy and five by
LTX-Credence. Furthermore, to facilitate the leadership change, Keith
Barnes will transition from Verigy CEO to Verigy chairman of the
board of directors as of Dec. 31, 2010, and Jorge Titinger will be
promoted to Verigy CEO and president.

""The two companies share a long legacy of innovation in test
solutions that meet customers' technology needs and enable them to
maximize profitability and competitiveness,"" said Keith Barnes,
Verigy chairman and CEO. ""By joining forces, we expect the combined
scale to strengthen our global presence, realize significant
synergies and provide substantial benefits to our customers,
shareholders and employees.""

""Verigy has a well-established presence in the high-performance
digital, complex mixed-signal and RF-SOC segments while LTX-Credence
has a broad SOC market footprint and expertise in cost-optimized
solutions,"" said Jorge Titinger, Verigy president and COO. ""We expect
the combination will enable the new Verigy to drive sustainable
long-term growth and shareholder value through the expansion of our
product and technology portfolio as well as our existing customer
relationships. We are very excited by the possibilities that this new
company represents.""

""Strategically, the complementary fit of Verigy and LTX-Credence
makes us ideal merger partners, and we believe this combination will
position the new Verigy for market leadership in the semiconductor
test industry,"" said David Tacelli, LTX-Credence president and CEO.
""We look forward to working together to build a new company
structured for consistent, strong financial performance.""

Transaction Terms

Under the terms of the agreement, the transaction will either be
effected through a reorganization where Verigy and LTX-Credence would
be wholly owned subsidiaries of Holdco, a newly created subsidiary,
or through a merger where LTX-Credence would become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Verigy. LTX-Credence shareholders will receive a fixed
exchange ratio of 0.96 shares of Verigy stock or Holdco stock for
each share of LTX-Credence stock. Upon closing, Verigy or Holdco, as
applicable, will issue approximately 49 million shares on a fully
diluted basis to complete the transaction. At that time, Verigy and
LTX-Credence shareholders will own approximately 56 percent and 44
percent, respectively, of the combined company.

The combined company also expects to realize substantial synergies
within one year of the close of the deal, with annual cost savings
expected to reach at least $25 million, primarily from increased
efficiencies in manufacturing and reduced operating expenses.

The transaction is subject to the approval of shareholders from both
companies as well as other customary closing conditions and
regulatory approvals. The companies expect the transaction to close
in the first half of calendar 2011.

Shares of the combined company will trade on the NASDAQ under the
symbol ""VRGY."" Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisor and Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati acted as legal counsel to Verigy. J.P.
Morgan acted as financial advisor and WilmerHale acted as legal
counsel to LTX-Credence.

Verigy Odd Lot and Repurchase Program

 Verigy also announced today its board of directors has authorized an
odd lot program that will result in the purchase of approximately 2.3
million shares, or 4 percent of Verigy's current outstanding shares,
from shareholders holding less than 100 shares of the combined
company following the transaction. This is expected to simplify the
combined company's capital structure. In addition, Verigy's board has
authorized an annual stock repurchase program of up to 10 percent of
the Verigy's current outstanding shares, effective for approximately
12 months following the transaction. The repurchases are expected to
be funded from available cash and short-term investments. The odd lot
repurchase and stock repurchase program are both subject to
shareholder approval at Verigy's next shareholder meeting.

Business Wire

SAN JOSE, Calif. & SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- April 30, 2012

Integrated Device Technology, Inc. (IDT ^ ®); (NASDAQ:IDTI), the Analog and
Digital Company delivering essential mixed-signal semiconductor solutions,
and PLX Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLXT) today announced that they have signed a
definitive agreement pursuant to which IDT will acquire PLX. Under the terms
of the agreement, unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both
companies, IDT will acquire all of the outstanding shares of PLX common stock
pursuant to an exchange offer, followed by a second step merger. In the
acquisition, PLX stockholders will receive (i) $3.50 in cash and (ii) 0.525
shares of IDT common stock for each PLX common share outstanding. Based on
IDTs closing stock price on April 27, 2012, the transaction is valued at
approximately $7.00 per PLX share and results in a total transaction value of
approximately $330 million.

The proposed acquisition of PLX Technology represents an exciting expansion
of IDTs core serial switching and interface business, said Ted Tewksbury,
president and CEO at IDT. Our two companies have complementary product sets,
technologies and customer bases, and we share a focus on delivering the
highest-performance system-level interconnect solutions for data centers and
other applications. IDT and its shareholders will benefit from the top-line
contribution of our enhanced product portfolio as well as the increased
profitability provided through the added scale and expanded operating margin.
This transaction is aligned with our long-term strategy of expanding our core
businesses through organic growth and acquisitions.

This proposed transaction will enable our stockholders to realize significant
value today and benefit from the many growth and cost reduction opportunities
of the combined company, said Ralph Schmitt, president and CEO at PLX. We
expect that a transaction with IDT will enhance PLXs commitment to its
customers to deliver innovative technologies that meet their needs and
demands.

As a result of the combination, IDT anticipates it will achieve total run-rate
cost synergies, excluding transaction related charges, in excess of $35
million by fiscal year 2014. IDT currently projects the transaction to be
accretive to non-GAAP earnings by the third fiscal quarter of 2013 with more
significant accretion by fiscal year 2014, in each case based on an assumed
closing during the first fiscal quarter of 2013. Increased scale and expected
cost savings are expected to lower combined non-GAAP operating expenses,
generate significant operating margin expansion, and accelerate IDTs timing
to achieving its stated target operating model.

The companies expect that the proposed transaction will close as early as
IDTs first fiscal quarter 2013, which is the second quarter of calendar 2012.
The exchange offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including the
tender into the exchange offer by PLX stockholders of shares representing at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of PLX common stock on a fully
diluted basis, and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. IDT expects to
finance the cash portion of the acquisition through existing cash balances and
committed financing. The proposed transaction is not subject to any financing
condition.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, PLX may solicit superior proposals
from third parties for a go shop period of 30 calendar days continuing
through May 30, 2012. It is not anticipated that any developments will be
disclosed with regard to this process unless PLXs board of directors makes a
decision with respect to a potential superior proposal. Deutsche Bank, which
is acting as PLXs financial advisor, will advise PLX during the go shop
period. There are no guarantees that this process will result in a superior
proposal. The merger agreement provides IDT with a customary right to match a
superior proposal. The agreement also provides for certain break-up fees
payable to IDT in connection with the termination of the agreement in certain
circumstances.

J.P. Morgan is acting as financial advisor and Latham & Watkins LLP is acting
as legal advisor to IDT. Deutsche Bank is acting as financial advisor and
Baker & McKenzie LLP is acting as legal adviser to PLX.

Additional Information

The exchange offer described herein has not yet commenced. This press release
is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an offer to sell
or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any
sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or
sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the
securities laws of any such jurisdiction. Any offer will only be made through
a prospectus, which is part of a registration statement on Form S-4, as well
as a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO, an offer to purchase, form of
letter of transmittal and other documents relating to the exchange offer
(collectively, the Exchange Offer Materials), each to be filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) by IDT. In addition, PLX will
file with the SEC a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the exchange offer. IDT and PLX expect to mail the Exchange
Offer Materials, as well as the Schedule 14D-9, to PLX stockholders. Investors
and security holders are urged to carefully read these documents and the other
documents relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
when they become available because these documents will contain important
information relating to the exchange offer and related transactions. Investors
and security holders may obtain a free copy of these documents after they have
been filed with the SEC, and other annual, quarterly and special reports and
other information filed with the SEC by IDT or PLX, at the SECs website at
www.sec.gov. In addition, such materials will be available from IDT or PLX, or
by calling Innisfree M&A Incorporated, the information agent for the exchange
offer, toll-free at (877) 456-3463. Banks and brokers may call collect at
(212) 750-5833.

Neither IDT nor PLX is asking for stockholders to vote or soliciting proxies
in connection with the exchange offer transaction at this time. Upon
consummation of the offer, IDT and PLX may seek votes or proxies in connection
with the proposed back-end merger from holders of PLX shares not tendered in
the offer. IDT, PLX and their respective officers and directors therefore may
be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from PLXs
stockholders in connection with the proposed merger. A description of certain
interests of the directors and executive officers of PLX is set forth in PLXs
Form 10-K/A, Amendment No. 1, in Part III thereof, which was filed with the
SEC on April 27, 2012. A description of certain interests of the directors and
executive officers of IDT is set forth in IDTs proxy statement for its 2011
annual meeting, which was filed with the SEC on August 1, 2011. To the extent
holdings of either companys securities by their respective directors and
certain officers have subsequently changed, such changes have been reflected
on Forms 4 filed with the SEC.

Business Wire

HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. & NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. -- January 10, 2011

SMSC (NASDAQ: SMSC), a leading semiconductor company providing Smart
Mixed-Signal Connectivity solutions, and Conexant Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:
CNXT), a leading supplier of innovative semiconductor solutions for imaging,
audio, embedded modem, and video surveillance applications, today announced
the signing of a definitive agreement under which SMSC will purchase all of
the outstanding shares of Conexant in a stock and cash transaction valued at
approximately $284 million including the assumption of Conexants net debt.
The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both
companies.

Combined Company Highlights:

  * Complementary connectivity product portfolios to target more expansive set
    of computing, consumer, industrial and automotive applications,
  * Serves key customers with more complete product solutions,
  * Creates a stronger analog/mixed-signal R&D team with over 900 engineers
    globally,
  * Combined company has the scale and resources to enhance SMSCs financial
    model with a combined trailing twelve month revenue of approximately $632
    million,
  * Anticipated annualized pre-tax cost synergies of $8 to $10 million by the
    end of SMSCs fourth quarter of fiscal 2012,
  * Acquisition expected to be accretive to non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP
    operating margins and non-GAAP earnings per share immediately upon
    closing.

The combination of Conexants imaging, audio, embedded modem and video
products  with SMSCs broad connectivity solutions targeting the computing,
consumer, industrial and automotive markets provides for a highly
complementary merger of talent and technology. Headquartered in Newport Beach,
California, Conexant has approximately 600 employees worldwide, including over
230 in Asia.

We believe that combining the growth potential of Conexant and SMSC will
allow us to leverage complementary technology and engineering resources to
provide our customers with expanded solutions in connectivity and content,
said Christine King, President & Chief Executive Officer of SMSC. We plan to
focus our resources on the areas of highest return and believe that our
respective sales and supply chain relationships will help create a platform to
grow our businesses. We expect the acquisition will be accretive to non-GAAP
EPS immediately upon close. In addition, we expect to capture significant
operating efficiencies that will position us to increase earnings growth.
SMSCs larger scale should position us to increase our R&D productivity and
drive profitability and shareholder value.

In our industry, size and scope provide a significant advantage with
customers and suppliers,"" said Scott Mercer, Conexant's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer. ""SMSC and Conexant share similar core competencies in
analog and mixed-signal design, possess complementary product portfolios, and
count many customers in common. By joining forces, we get the opportunity to
take advantage of economies of scale and drive profitable growth. I am
convinced that combining our companies will best serve the interests of
Conexant stockholders, customers, and employees moving forward.""

Sailesh Chittipeddi, currently President & Chief Operating Officer at
Conexant, will join SMSC upon close of the acquisition as Executive Vice
President, reporting to Christine King. Mr. Chittipeddis responsibilities
will include all product lines and global marketing and engineering functions
for SMSC. Mr. Chittipeddi joined Conexant in 2006. In his role as President &
Chief Operating Officer, he had worldwide responsibility for engineering,
operations, quality and marketing.

Under the terms of the agreement, for each share of Conexant that they own,
Conexant stockholders will receive approximately $2.25 consisting of $1.125 in
cash and a fraction of a share of SMSC common stock equal to $1.125 divided by
the volume weighted average price of SMSC common stock for the 20 trading days
ending on the second trading day prior to closing, but in no event more than
0.04264 nor less than 0.03489 shares of SMSC common stock. The total cash
consideration to be paid in the transaction is approximately $98 million and
the total number of shares of SMSC common stock to be issued (including the
assumption of outstanding Conexant restricted stock units) is approximately
2.9 to 3.6 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of
calendar 2011 subject to the satisfaction of regulatory requirements, approval
by Conexant shareholders and other customary closing conditions. SMSC expects
to realize approximately $8 to $10 million in annualized pre-tax cost
synergies by the end of SMSCs fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 as a result of
the consolidation of support functions and optimization of the supply chain
across a larger base.

H&R Block (NYSE: HRB) announced today it has signed a definitive merger
agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of 2SS Holdings,
Inc., developer of TaxACT digital tax preparation solutions, for
$287.5 million in cash.

The company plans to combine its H&R Block At Home digital business
and the acquired TaxACT business, into a single unit led by the
TaxACT management team, but continue to offer both brands in the
market place.

""This transaction is a significant step for H&R Block in a segment
that is strategically important. This will provide us with innovative
growth-oriented leadership to accelerate our digital tax offerings
and results,"" said Alan Bennett, president and chief executive
officer of H&R Block. ""I am looking forward to working with the
TaxACT management team on developing our multi-brand digital strategy
for the future.""

TaxACT has approximately 70 full-time associates and is headquartered
in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. More than 5 million tax filers used TaxACT
last season through online, desktop download and professional
software, with the vast majority of those clients filing online.

Lance Dunn, president of TaxACT, said, ""The entire team is excited by
the opportunity to partner with H&R Block. We are committed to
providing a tremendous value for customers by continuing to offer the
TaxACT Free Federal Edition.""

H&R Block estimates the transaction would add $0.05 to earnings per
share in its fiscal year ending April 30, 2011, assuming the
transaction closes by the end of the current calendar year. The
purchase will be funded by excess available liquidity from
cash-on-hand or short-term borrowings. Completion of the transaction
is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions,
including the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

        unsolicited bid.
    --  Fibrek's Board of Directors has unanimously determined that it
        would be in the best interests of Fibrek and its shareholders
        to support the Mercer Offer and recommends that shareholders
        tender their common shares to the Mercer Offer

MONTREAL, Feb. 10, 2012 /CNW Telbec/ - Fibrek Inc. and Mercer International
Inc. announced today that they have entered into a support agreement (the
""Support Agreement"") pursuant to which Mercer will offer to acquire all of the
issued and outstanding common shares of Fibrek (the ""Mercer Offer"") by way of
take-over bid.

The consideration to be offered for each common share of Fibrek under the
Mercer Offer will be, at each shareholder's option, (i) $1.30 in cash; (ii)
0.1540 of a share of Mercer common stock (""Mercer Shares""); or (iii) $0.54 in
cash plus 0.0903 of a Mercer Share, subject to proration on the basis of a
maximum of $70 million in cash and approximately 11.7 million Mercer Shares.
Such consideration represents a premium of approximately 70% over the volume
weighted average price of the common shares of Fibrek on the Toronto Stock
Exchange (""TSX"") for the 20 trading days ending on November 28, 2011, and a
premium of 81% over the closing price the day before the announcement of the
unsolicited bid of Abitibi. The consideration also represents a 30% premium
over Abitibi's unsolicited bid.

""This has been a challenging time for Fibrek as we have sought to maximize
value for our shareholders and advance the interests of our other
stakeholders. We are pleased to support Mercer's offer and recommend it to our
shareholders as we believe this offer meets our goal and provides a
significant premium relative to Abitibi's unsolicited offer"" stated Hubert T.
Lacroix, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Fibrek.

""We had a responsibility to our shareholders to pursue alternative options in
their best interests and that is exactly what we have done in supporting this
offer from Mercer, a leader in the industry who is committed to market pulp,""
added Pierre Gabriel Côté, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fibrek.
""There are significant similarities between Fibrek and Mercer given that we
are both pulp producers with a culture of operational excellence,"" concluded
Mr. Côté.

The Board has received a fairness opinion from its financial advisor, TD
Securities Inc., that the consideration to be received under the Mercer Offer
is fair, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of Fibrek (other
than those who have entered into lock-up agreements with Abitibi). In
addition, as previously disclosed, the Board of Directors has also received a
formal valuation prepared by Canaccord Genuity Corp. The consideration to be
offered to Fibrek shareholders by Mercer is in the fair market value range of
$1.25 to $1.45 per common share of Fibrek established by Canaccord Genuity
Corp.

Following receipt of such opinion and formal valuation, and in consultation
with its legal advisors, the Board of Directors has unanimously determined
that the consideration to be received by Fibrek shareholders under the Mercer
Offer is fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders. The Board
of Directors has further determined that it would be in the best interests of
Fibrek to support the Mercer Offer and enter into the Support Agreement and
recommend that shareholders tender their common shares to the Mercer Offer.

Each of the directors and officers of Fibrek have agreed to tender all common
shares held by them pursuant to lock-up agreements with Mercer.

Full details of the Mercer Offer will be included in a take-over bid circular
which is expected to be mailed to holders of common shares of Fibrek by
February 29, 2012. Once mailed, the Mercer Offer will be open for acceptance
for a period of 35 days unless withdrawn or extended and will be conditional
upon, among other things, Mercer acquiring such number of common shares that
represent at least 50.1% of the outstanding common shares calculated on a
fully-diluted basis, receipt of customary regulatory consents and approvals
and the approval of a simple majority of Mercer's shareholders in connection
with the issuance of the Mercer Shares. Mercer's two largest shareholders and
Chief Executive Officer, which hold in the aggregate approximately 44% of
Mercer's outstanding shares have already committed to support the Mercer Offer
and have entered into support agreements to ensure that Mercer shareholder
approval is received. Pursuant to the Support Agreement, Fibrek has agreed to
waive the application of the shareholder rights plan to the Mercer Offer and
to take no action to waive the application of the shareholder rights plan to
any other acquisition proposal. The Support Agreement entered into by Fibrek
and Mercer contains, among other things, a termination fee of $8.5 million
payable by Fibrek in certain circumstances, including the acceptance of an
unsolicited superior proposal from a third party. Mercer has also been granted
a right to match in respect of competing proposals.

Mercer has also agreed to purchase 32,320,000 special warrants of Fibrek on a
private placement basis, at a price of $1.00 per special warrant for total
subscription proceeds of $32,320,000. The special warrants are convertible
into common shares of Fibrek on a one-for-one basis. Conversion of the special
warrants is automatic in certain events and otherwise at the option of Mercer
subject to certain conditions. The special warrants are also redeemable by
Mercer or Fibrek in certain events at their subscription price, including in
the event that Fibrek receives and supports a superior proposal. The proceeds
of the private placement will be deposited in trust at closing and will be
releasable to Fibrek on conversion of the special warrants or to Mercer in the
event of a redemption. Proceeds from the private placement are initially to be
used by Fibrek to reduce net debt given (i) the recent costs associated with
its strategic alternatives review process in response to Abitibi's unsolicited
offer, (ii) the high level of RBK Pulp inventories and lower than anticipated
sales which have resulted in a 5-week market shutdown of the Fairmont Mill
effective February 20, 2012 and an increased need for liquidity, and (iii)
capital expenditures required in connection with Fibrek's power-generation
initiatives and other growth and diversification opportunities. Completion of
the private placement and the conversion of the special warrants is subject to
a number of conditions, including the approval of the TSX, but is not
conditional on the successful completion of the Mercer Offer. In the event the
Mercer Offer is not completed, the private placement will provide Fibrek with
necessary funding to continue operations and the execution of its strategic
plan.

Business Wire

DEVENS, Mass. -- March 14, 2011

American Superconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: AMSC), a global power
technologies company, today announced that it has signed a definitive
agreement to acquire The Switch Engineering Oy, a power technologies company
headquartered in Finland. The 190-million-Euro acquisition (approximately
US$265 million based on current exchange rates) is expected to be immediately
accretive and support AMSCs growth to US$1 billion in annual revenues. With
sales of both power converter systems and permanent magnet generators to wind
turbine manufacturers in China, Europe, Korea and the U.S., this acquisition
will diversify AMSCs customer base and channels to market.

With highly complementary engineering capabilities and product offerings, the
combination of The Switch and AMSC will provide significant additional value
for our customers, partners and investors, said Greg Yurek, founder and chief
executive officer of AMSC. Both AMSC and The Switch are well positioned in
Asia, which is now the worlds largest and fastest growing wind power market.
Our combined company is expected to be serving Chinas three largest wind
turbine manufacturers  Sinovel, Goldwind and Dongfang  in various
capacities. The Switch will also significantly strengthen AMSCs presence in
Western wind markets with customers such as GE and create a new channel to
market for AMSC in addition to our Windtec licensees. In short, this
combination will create a global wind powerhouse.

AMSCs growth in recent years has primarily been driven by the sale of wind
turbine core electrical components and full wind turbine electrical control
systems (ECS) to Windtec licensees and strategic partners. The Switch provides
a substantial existing channel for power electronics and control system sales
to other global wind turbine manufacturers. The Switch focuses on the
production of power converter systems (PCS), which are a subsystem of full
wind turbine ECS. By joining forces with The Switch, AMSC also sees the
opportunity to further enhance the performance and reduce the cost of its PCS
and ECS offerings. The Switch today offers PCSs with power ratings ranging
from 1 megawatt (MW) to 6 MW.

The Switch also opens a new addressable market opportunity exceeding $1
billion annually with its portfolio of proprietary permanent magnet generators
(PMG). PMG are a powerful new class of generators that are utilized inside an
increasing number of both geared and direct drive wind turbines. The Switch
today offers low-, medium- and high-speed PMG up to 6 MW in power rating.
These PMG systems, which already are being utilized by several companies in
Europe, the U.S. and Asia, will extend the technology portfolio currently
available to Windtec customers and increase AMSCs potential value per MW of
wind power. AMSC also expects to leverage The Switchs strong background in
advanced synchronous generators to commercialize superconductor generators for
direct drive SeaTitan wind turbines.

In todays market, there is a great demand for multi-megawatt turbines
utilizing advanced power electronics and permanent magnet generators  a trend
that AMSC and The Switch can take advantage of, said Jukka-Pekka Mäkinen,
President and Chief Executive Officer of The Switch. From virtually all
angles  culturally, commercially and strategically  the synergies of a
combination of The Switch and AMSC were immediately evident to both of our
organizations. After the closing, we will be able to exploit our combined
engineering and manufacturing expertise to speed up our clients access to
markets as well as to significantly increase the number of wind turbines
Powered by AMSC.

For calendar year 2010, The Switch generated approximately US$179 million in
total revenue and approximately US$15 million in net income. The transaction
is valued at approximately US$265 million, with approximately US$186 million
to be paid in cash and the remainder to be paid in the form of AMSC stock
based in part on the average closing price of AMSCs stock prior to the
closing. These figures are based on current exchange rates. AMSC plans to use
its existing cash balance to finance the deal. Closing of the transaction,
which has been approved by both companies Boards of Directors and is subject
to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, is expected by
August 31, 2011.

AMSC Financial Guidance Update

In conjunction with todays announcement, AMSC is updating its guidance for
fiscal year 2010 (ending March 31, 2011). The company expects that its
revenues will be toward the lower end of its $430 million to $440 million
forecast range. Due primarily to anticipated one-time costs related to the
acquisition, AMSC is reducing its net income guidance from a range of $48.0
million to $50.0 million, or $0.99 to $1.04 per diluted share, to a range of
$44.0 million to $46.0 million, or $0.91 to $0.95 per diluted share (see table
at end of this press release for details). The companys non-GAAP net income
guidance is being reduced from a range of $64.5 million to $66.5 million, or
$1.33 to $1.38 per diluted share, to a range of $63.5 million to $65.5
million, or $1.31 to $1.35 per diluted share. Please refer to the financial
table included below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP guidance.

We expect to achieve another record year of revenues and earnings in fiscal
2010, said Yurek. However, AMSCs organic revenues and earnings are expected
to decline sequentially in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 from the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2010 before growth resumes in subsequent quarters. For full
fiscal 2011, we expect organic revenue growth to slow to about 5 to 10 percent
year over year before increasing again in fiscal 2012. We also expect our
organic non-GAAP earnings per share to decline by as much as 15 percent year
over year due to a higher share count, somewhat lower gross margin related
primarily to product mix, foreign exchange headwinds, and a full year of
dilution from minority investments.

Fiscal 2011 will be a transition year for AMSC  one in which we continue to
develop and deploy new products, book new orders, and implement new strategies
for growth while continuing to grow our top line and generate solid profits.
We are now in the process of reengineering our company to build on the strong
platform we have established over the past several years. As of April 1, 2011,
we are reorganizing our business into Wind and Grid reporting segments. The
Switch is expected to play a key role in our Wind business and serve as a
catalyst for growth both in the near and long term. As a result, our combined
company is expected to grow more rapidly and profitably beyond fiscal 2011 to
achieve our target of US$1 billion in revenues and operating margins in excess

Any statements in this release about future expectations, plans and prospects
for the company, including our expectations regarding the future financial
performance of the company, the proposed acquisition of The Switch and other
statements containing the words ""believes,"" ""anticipates,"" ""plans,"" ""expects,""
""will"" and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There are
a number of important factors that could materially impact the value of our
common stock or cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated
by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include: we have a history of
operating losses, and we may incur losses in the future; our operating results
may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may fall below
expectations in any particular fiscal quarter; a significant portion of our
revenues are derived from a single customer and revenues from this customer
may decline in future periods; adverse changes in domestic and global economic
conditions could adversely affect our business; changes in exchange rates
could adversely affect our financial results; we may not realize all of the
sales expected from our backlog of orders and contracts; we rely upon third
party suppliers for the components and subassemblies of many of our products,
making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations; we have not
manufactured our Amperium wire in commercial quantities, and a failure to
manufacture our Amperium wire in commercial quantities at acceptable cost and
quality levels would substantially limit our future revenue and profit
potential; and our patents may not provide meaningful protection for our
technology, which could result in us losing some or all of our market
position. Reference is made to these and other factors discussed in the ""Risk
Factors"" section of the company's most recent quarterly or annual report filed

statements included in this press release represent the company's views as of

Note: Non-GAAP net income (loss) is defined by the company as net income
(loss) before amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, restructuring
and impairments, stock-based compensation, other unusual charges and any tax
effects related to these items. The company believes non-GAAP net income
(loss) is an important measurement for management and investors given the
effect that these non-cash or non-recurring charges have on the company's net
income (loss). The company regards non-GAAP net income (loss) as a useful
measure of operating performance and cash flow to complement operating income,
net income (loss) and other GAAP financial performance measures.

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's
performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes
amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly
comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The
non-GAAP measures included in this release, however, should be considered in
addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, operating income,
cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance
with GAAP. A reconciliation of forecasted non-GAAP to GAAP net income for
fiscal year 2010 is set forth in the table above. The company did not present
a reconciliation of forecasted combined non-GAAP to GAAP net earnings per
share for full fiscal year 2011 because it is unable to estimate the
amortization of acquired intangibles arising from the planned acquisition of
The Switch.

MELBOURNE, Australia,  July 11, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Australia Acquisition
Corp. (""AAC""); (Nasdaq:AAC); (Nasdaq:AACOW); (Nasdaq:AACOU) and Harbinger
Capital Partners LLC (""HCP"") announced today that they have agreed to a
transaction in which AAC will acquire certain assets held by HCP in exchange
for newly issued common shares in AAC. The assets being acquired by AAC are a
majority interest in Asian Coast Development (Canada) Ltd. (""ACDL""), an
international hotel and casino development company currently focused in
Vietnam, and a minority interest in Ferrous Resources Limited (""Ferrous""), an
iron ore producer focusing on the expansion  of an export iron ore business in
the Iron Quadrangle in Minas Gerais, Brazil. These assets are collectively
valued at approximately $350 million.

The proposed transaction is expected to be completed in August 2012. Following
the closing, the acquired assets will create the initial platform for a
globally diversified holding company. Shares of the new company, which will be
named Harbinger Global Corp., are expected to trade on the NASDAQ Stock
Market. Philip A. Falcone, CEO of HCP, will serve as Executive Chairman of the
new company while Peter Ziegler will serve as CEO. Messrs. Falcone and Ziegler
will work together to develop and maximize value of the initial assets as well
as to identify new opportunities to grow the company.

Mr. Falcone commented, ""This transaction marks an important milestone for us
in forming a new permanent capital vehicle focused on emerging markets. We
continue to see opportunities to enhance value for Asian Coast Development in
the fast-growing Far East hotel and gaming industry and Ferrous Resources, as
it moves to increase organic iron ore production in Brazil. Additionally, we
see this platform as providing investors in our funds with enhanced liquidity
and opportunities for diversity and meaningful capital appreciation.""

Mr. Ziegler added, ""We are extremely pleased to be partnering with Harbinger
Capital Partners on this transaction. The acquisition of these assets provides
AAC an opportunity to capitalize on the continuing growth of global emerging
markets and, particularly those markets in the Asia Pacific region. This
transaction not only brings together some exciting assets but also the
management and financing expertise required to maximize their value. The AAC
team and I look forward to working closely with the HCP team.""

    government to develop a large-scale casino resort project on the Ho Tram
    Strip

    are under-served by existing facilities in the local gaming and

  * Six high quality iron ore assets in the states of Minas Gerais and Bahia
    totaling 4.8 billion tons of Joint Ore Reserve Committee (""JORC"")
    resources

  * EBITDA positive, targeting production of 3 million tons per year (""Mtpy"")
    in 2012 and 17 Mtpy by 2016 with limited external capital requirements

Transaction Details:

Under the terms of the proposed transaction, Harbinger Capital Partners will
receive 25,429,299 newly issued shares of AAC common stock in consideration
for the stake in ACDL and 9,295,534 common shares of AAC in consideration for
the stake in Ferrous. A portion of the consideration will be issued in the
form of preferred stock, convertible into AAC common stock.

Upon closing of the transaction, the newly combined company, which will be
named Harbinger Global Corp., will hold 65.4% of the outstanding common stock
and 72.2% of the outstanding Series V preferred stock of ACDL, as well as 9.7%
of Ferrous' outstanding common stock.  Harbinger Capital Partners will hold
between approximately 83% and 96% of the outstanding common stock in the new
entity and current stockholders of the Company will own between approximately
4% to 17% of Harbinger Global Corp depending on the amount of redemptions by
existing stockholders of AAC in the tender offer discussed below.

Following the closing of the proposed transaction, Philip Falcone will serve
as Executive Chairman of Harbinger Global Corp. and Peter Ziegler will serve
as Vice Chairman and continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer. 

The cash currently held in the Company's trust account will be used to fund
potential redemptions by AAC's public common stockholders as well as AAC's
administrative and transaction expenses. Any remaining cash will be used for
working capital, to facilitate growth initiatives, and other general corporate
purposes.

The AAC Board of Directors and the participating HCP funds have approved the
proposed transaction, which is expected to be completed in August 2012. As a
condition to closing the transaction, AAC will provide its current
stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock for
an amount in cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on
deposit in the trust account established to hold the proceeds of AAC's initial
public offering, less taxes, upon the consummation of the business
transaction. The transaction is not subject to approval by AAC stockholders,
but does require that the holders of at least 8% (approximately $5 million) of
the shares issued in AAC's IPO not tender their shares for redemption. AAC
intends to conduct these potential redemptions pursuant to the tender offer
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). The tender offer
documents to be filed with the SEC will contain substantially the same
financial and other information about the business transaction and the
redemption rights as is required under the SEC's proxy rules. The tender offer
is expected to close simultaneously with the closing of the business
combination.

The PrinceRidge Group LLC is serving as exclusive financial advisor to
Australia Acquisition Corp., and Kelley Drye & Warren LLP is serving as legal
counsel. 

Additional information about the transaction, as well as the operations of
ACDL and Ferrous, will be contained in an investor presentation that will be
made public today and filed by Australia Acquisition Corp. with the SEC.
Interested parties should visit the SEC website at www.sec.gov.

Business Wire

NORWELL, Mass. -- January 26, 2011

Clean Harbors, Inc. (Clean Harbors) (NYSE: CLH), the leading provider of
environmental and energy and industrial services throughout North America,
today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire
Calgary-based Badger Daylighting Ltd. (Badger) (TSX: BAD), North Americas
largest provider of Hydrovac Services. Under the terms of the agreement, Clean
Harbors will purchase Badger in an all-cash transaction for a total
consideration of approximately CAD $247 million. The acquisition is subject to
approval by regulators and Badger shareholders, as well as other customary
closing conditions, and is expected to be completed during the second quarter
of 2011.

Under the terms of the agreement, Clean Harbors will acquire 100% of Badgers
outstanding common shares in exchange for approximately CAD $222 million in
cash (CAD $20.50 for each Badger share), and the assumption of approximately
CAD $25 million of Badger net debt. Clean Harbors expects the acquisition will
be immediately accretive, excluding any one-time fees and acquisition-related
expenses.

Badger maintains a network of 82 operating centers in key areas throughout
Canada and the United States. Badger has more than 400 employees and operates
a fleet of approximately 410 custom-built hydrovac units. The company
generated CAD $135 million in revenues and CAD $35 million of EBITDA in 2009.

The acquisition of Badger Daylighting affords us an opportunity to
significantly expand our Energy and Industrial Services business across the
U.S. and Canada, while adding a recognized innovator in the Hydrovac field,
said Alan S. McKim, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Badger services a
client base of more than 5,000 customers, which will provide Clean Harbors
with substantial cross-selling opportunities. From a geographic perspective,
this transaction aligns well with our existing footprint, as Badger serves key
markets, particularly across Western Canada.

Badger has established an outstanding reputation in the markets it serves and
presents a compelling value proposition for customers, McKim said. Its
Hydrovac system is based on custom-built equipment that ensures safety,
productivity and all-season versatility. We are confident that Badger will be
a strong addition to our broad array of current service offerings and that
Clean Harbors will leverage its sales and marketing strength to accelerate
Badgers growth throughout the U.S., which currently accounts for 40% of
Badgers revenues.

Tor Wilson, Badgers President and CEO, said, We believe that this
transaction provides fair value for Badgers business while providing full
liquidity to all shareholders. Clean Harbors has the ability to greatly expand
Badgers presence in the US market through its extensive market knowledge and
contacts.

McKim concluded, Given our acquisition expertise and integration
capabilities, we are confident that we can quickly and seamlessly integrate
Badger into Clean Harbors once we receive the necessary approvals. We see
strong potential prospects for the combined company and are currently
targeting a second-quarter completion to the transaction. We intend to
maintain the Badger brand and operate the company as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Clean Harbors. We look forward to welcoming Badgers employees and
franchisees into the Clean Harbors family.

The Company expects to provide additional information on the Badger
acquisition on its regularly scheduled fourth-quarter and year-end conference
call in late February.

  PR Newswire

  ST. LOUIS, Dec. 19, 2011

ST. LOUIS, Dec. 19, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Belden Inc. (NYSE: BDC), a global
leader in signal transmission solutions for mission-critical applications,
today announced its intention to make an all-cash offer to acquire RuggedCom
Inc. for C$22.00 per share, which implies a total purchase price of
approximately C$280 million (the ""Offer"").

Highlights

  * Combined company would be a clear leader in the industrial networking
    solutions market;
  * All-cash offer of C$22.00 per RuggedCom share;
  * Offer represents a substantial 62% premium to the closing RuggedCom share
    price of C$13.61 as of December 16, 2011;
  * Cash offer provides immediate value for RuggedCom shareholders;
  * Offer is not subject to any financing contingency.

Under the terms of the Offer, Belden will propose to acquire all of the
outstanding RuggedCom common shares for C$22.00 in cash per share. This
represents a 62% premium to the closing share price of C$13.61 as of December
16, 2011. Importantly, given the net cash position of RuggedCom's balance
sheet, the offer also represents an 87% premium to the enterprise value as of
that date.

""For RuggedCom shareholders, the Offer is compelling in that it provides
certainty of value and immediate liquidity at an attractive premium to
RuggedCom's pre-offer share price,"" said John Stroup, President and CEO of
Belden. ""This Offer is grounded in Belden's growth strategy to enhance our
global networking business portfolio. We believe that the combined company
would be a technology leader in Belden's target market segments and would
deliver considerable value for Belden customers and shareholders, as well as
provide growth opportunities to RuggedCom employees.""

Business Wire

NEW YORK -- April 8, 2013

FXCM Inc. (FXCM) (NYSE: FXCM), a leading online provider of foreign
exchange, or FX, trading and related services, today announced it is proposing
to merge with and acquire Gain Capital Holdings LLC (GAIN) (NYSE: GCAP).

The proposal was communicated this evening in a letter from FXCM to Gains
Board of Directors, to inform them of FXCMs desire to reach agreement on a
transaction that would create the industry leader in online FX trading.

FXCM believes that the substantial potential operating and capital synergies
between the two companies would result in an accretive deal with a strong
growth profile and improved economies of scale, said Drew Niv, CEO of FXCM.
Additionally, FXCM believes customers of both FXCM and Gain will greatly
benefit from the expected improvement of financial strength and stability of
the combined entity.

This proposed merger is the highest priority for FXCM, and we hope that Gain
is as excited as we are about the potential a combined company could have.

The proposed transaction would give Gain shareholders 0.3996 shares of FXCM
Class A common stock for each share of Gain common stock. Based on FXCMs
closing price of $13.39 on Monday, April 8, 2013, this results in an offer
price of $5.35 per share of Gain common stock, which in aggregate would
represent $210.4 million in total value. This price represents a 25% premium
to Gains closing share price on April 8, 2013. FXCM is also prepared to offer
up to $50 million in cash consideration in lieu of FXCM shares.

^1 Pro forma figures exclude transaction fees and other expenses associated
with the proposed transaction.

^2 FXCM Adj. EBITDA excludes certain items relating to the IPO of FXCM and
other one-time charges and non-recurring items.

Conference Call

FXCM will host a conference call to discuss the proposed business combination
at 8:15 a.m. (EST) tomorrow. This conference call will be available to
domestic participants by dialing 877.303.9132 and 408.337.0136 for
international participants. The conference ID number is 34133919.

A live, audio webcast, a copy of FXCM's presentation and replay of this
conference call will also be available at http://ir.fxcm.com/.

The full text of the letter issued by FXCM to Gains Board of Directors
follows:

April 8, 2013

Board of Directors

GAIN Capital Holdings, Inc.
Bedminster One
135 Route 202/206
Bedminster, New Jersey 07921

Attention: Peter Quick, Chairman
Attention: Glenn Stevens, Chief Executive Officer

Dear Members of the Board:

I am writing to you, on behalf of the Board of Directors of FXCM Inc.
(FXCM), to make a proposal for a merger with GAIN Capital Holdings, Inc.
(GAIN). Under our proposal, we would be prepared to offer 0.3996 shares of
FXCM Class A common stock for each share of GAIN common stock (the
Proposal). Based on FXCMs closing price as of April 8, 2013 of $13.39, our
Proposal represents an offer price of $5.35 per GAIN share, which in aggregate
would represent $210.4 million in total value^(1). Our Proposal would entitle
GAINs shareholders to approximately 15.7 million shares of FXCM Class A
common stock, or a 16.2% ownership interest in the combined company. Depending
on the preferences of your shareholders and their potential desire for
immediate liquidity, we would be prepared to include consideration of $50
million of cash in lieu of stock. Our Proposal is not subject to any financing
contingency.

Our Proposal represents a 25% premium to GAINs closing stock price of $4.27
as of April 8, 2013^(1), and exceeds GAINs 52-week high^(2) of $5.31 on April
27, 2012. We believe that, based on various financial and operating metrics
outlined in more detail in the attached slide presentation (the
Presentation), the Proposal represents an attractive value proposition for
your shareholders. Moreover, we believe the substantial operating synergies,
capital efficiencies, expanded operating scale, and improved trading
characteristics of the combined company present a compelling rationale for
this transaction and an attractive opportunity for potential future
appreciation in value for GAIN shareholders.

Substantial Operating Synergies: As outlined on slide 11 of the Presentation,
we believe our overlap of products, target markets, and regulatory
requirements create a unique opportunity to potentially realize material
synergies through a merger. The regulatory requirements of maintaining a
presence in the worlds major FX markets create high fixed costs for brokers 
by combining businesses, these fixed costs can be leveraged over a larger
revenue base. We estimate that when integration is complete, synergies could
potentially drive in excess of $50 million in incremental run-rate EBITDA per
year.

Capital Efficiencies: We believe the combined entity could also potentially
realize significant balance sheet and regulatory capital efficiencies. As
outlined on slide 12 of the Presentation, we believe that a significant amount
of GAINs cash currently restricted as regulatory capital and designated as
collateral for trading partners could be freed up and deployed to further
enhance shareholder value.

Operating Scale: It is our strong view that scale is critical to success in
financial services and especially so in the global FX business, where fixed
costs and capital requirements are high and increase with every regulated
jurisdiction in which a firm has a presence. We believe that brokers with
operating scale enjoy consistently higher margins, lower costs with trading
partners and higher returns on equity. Slide 25 of the Presentation
illustrates this in a comparison of key metrics of comparable firms including
our own.

As illustrated in the Presentation, we believe that the combined company would
enjoy several enhanced attributes of our business model, and that GAINs
shareholders would benefit significantly by participating in the combined
company. In particular, we believe that:

  * Increased, operating scale enables us to maintain / grow trading volume
    and deliver more consistent results despite significant drops in
    volatility; and
  * International diversity has helped us mitigate the impact of changes in
    local regulations of any one particular key market, and that diversity
    plus our agency model mitigates exposure to potential adverse regulatory
    changes in the US market in particular

Attractive Trading Characteristics: We believe our Proposal offers GAIN
shareholders the opportunity to hold shares with improved trading
characteristics, including greater liquidity, more extensive research
coverage, fewer institutional investor limitations, and better correlation
with the positive performance of the business. With wider research analyst
coverage, average daily dollar trading volume over 8x the average volume of
GAIN, and a broader institutional investor base, we believe our proposed
exchange of FXCM shares for GAIN shares provides GAIN shareholders with an
immediate tangible benefit.

In summary, we believe our Proposal presents GAINs shareholders with the
opportunity to exchange their GAIN shares for a share in a combined business
with significant potential for upside from synergies and scale economics;
multiple capital efficiencies; better protection against market and regulatory
challenges; and potential for expanded liquidity to realize value in this
transaction or at points in the future.

We have engaged Barclays and Financial Technology Partners as our financial
advisors and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP as legal counsel. We have
completed an extensive, thorough analysis of GAINs publicly available
information. We do not believe that there are significant regulatory or other
impediments to the consummation of the proposed transaction. Our Proposal is
subject to the negotiation of a definitive merger agreement. Given our high
level of familiarity with the retail FX space and GAIN, we would need only to
conduct limited confirmatory due diligence and we are prepared to devote a
cross-functional team of senior managers to this important project.

We believe that a merger of our two companies would create an industry-leader,
allowing our shareholders to be part of a larger, stronger organization. This
merger is the highest priority for FXCM and has the unanimous support of our
Board of Directors and management team.

We aim to work together with you and the rest of GAINs Board to work through
the details of our Proposal. We want to ensure that all of our shareholders
are aware of the opportunity to participate in the combined company and are
therefore publicly releasing the contents of this letter.

My team and I are available to meet with you, your management team and your
Board as soon as practicable to discuss the terms and merits of our Proposal.

We look forward to hearing from you soon and working with the GAIN team to
advance the best interests of our respective companies and hope that you will
be as excited as we are about the benefits of this proposed combination.

^(1) Assumes 39.3 million total GAIN shares outstanding, including 35.5
million basic shares outstanding, 2.2 million shares of restricted stock and
1.6 million shares due to exercisable options. Also assumes 81.6 million fully
diluted FXCM shares outstanding.

^(2) Based on historical closing prices.

Yours truly,

Based on the NASDAQ closing prices of Dawson and TGC shares on Friday, March
18, 2011, the transaction is valued at approximately $157 million,
representing approximately $8.00 per TGC share.

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the
merger, TGC shareholders will receive 0.188 shares of Dawson stock for every
one share of TGC stock, provided that the average of the volume weighted
average price of Dawson common stock on the NASDAQ during the ten consecutive
trading days ending on the second business day prior to the date of the
shareholders' meetings of Dawson and TGC to be called for the purpose of
approving the transaction is equal to or greater than $32.54 but less than or
equal to $52.54.  In the event that the average of the volume weighted average
price of Dawson's common stock is outside of that range, then the parties, at
their respective option, shall be entitled to terminate the transaction
following good faith negotiations to determine a modified, mutually acceptable
exchange ratio.  For the ten consecutive trading days ended March 18, 2011,
the average of the volume weighted average price of Dawson's common stock was
$44.16.

At the closing of the transaction, it is anticipated that Dawson will issue
approximately 3.7 million shares in exchange for the approximately 19.6
million shares of TGC stock outstanding.  Upon completion of the transaction,
Dawson will have approximately 11.7 million shares outstanding, with current
Dawson shareholders owning approximately 68% of the combined company and
current TGC shareholders owning approximately 32%.  

Boards of Directors of both companies have approved the transaction, and
directors and officers representing approximately 29% of TGC outstanding
shares and approximately 4% of Dawson outstanding shares have agreed to vote
in favor of the Merger.  

The closing of the transaction is anticipated to be completed by late second
quarter or early third quarter of 2011, subject to approval by holders of 80%
of the outstanding shares of TGC and a majority of the Dawson shares present
and voting at the special meeting, as well as certain other closing conditions
and regulatory approvals.  

Raymond James & Associates, Inc. served as financial advisor to Dawson while
Southwest Securities, Inc. served as financial advisor to TGC.

Upon closing of the transaction, Wayne Whitener, President, CEO and Director
of TGC, will join the Board of Directors of Dawson along with Allen T.
McInnes, Ph.D., current TGC Director and Dean of the Texas Tech Jerry S. Rawls
College of Business Administration.  Mr. Whitener will continue as President
and Chief Operating Officer of TGC, which after the transaction will be a
wholly owned subsidiary of Dawson. Rob Wood, President of Eagle Canada, TGC's
wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, will remain in his role as President of
Eagle Canada.  Each of these named executives will enter into three-year
employment agreements with the continuing entity.

Stephen Jumper, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dawson, said: ""We are
excited to welcome the shareholders of TGC as shareholders of Dawson.
 Likewise, we are excited to welcome the employees of TGC and its subsidiary
Eagle Canada, Inc. to the Dawson family along with their respective clients.""

Jumper continued: ""We believe the combination of these companies provides
opportunities to better serve the combined company's expanded client base with
higher channel count capacity, greater geographic diversification of the
combined entity operations and blending of operational, technical and regional
expertise.  With the ability to share equipment and personnel resources, the
combined companies will be able to provide its clients with the required
channel counts to produce higher resolution images, enhanced efficiencies
related to logistical improvements of crew timing while increasing utilization
rates for all crews with an expanded order book.""

Wayne Whitener, President and Chief Executive Officer of TGC, said: ""We are
pleased to join forces with Dawson Geophysical to create a strong and more
dynamic organization capable of providing a multitude of seismic and
geophysical services to our combined client base.  We are excited about the
market position and growth potential of Dawson Geophysical going forward.
 This transaction is a clear win-win for our shareholders, clients and
employees.  I look forward to our contributing to the success of the combined
organization.""

Jumper concluded: ""The timing of this transaction creates an expanded
opportunity to benefit all of our clients as demand for advanced seismic
services continues to increase in the lower 48 states and Canada.  The
combined operating platform  services, people and equipment  positions our
shareholders and employees to capture any upside in the onshore North American
seismic market.""

year after closing.

Under the terms of the transaction, which has been approved by the boards of
directors of both companies, Allos stockholders will receive a fixed ratio of

Combined Company Product Offering

AMAG received FDA approval for FERAHEME in June 2009 for the treatment of IDA
in adult patients with CKD. Patients with IDA and CKD are treated in a variety
of settings, including hematology/oncology infusion centers, hospitals, and
nephrology clinics where many CKD patients receive IV iron. Additionally, IDA
and CKD are both common concomitant conditions in oncology patients, and
FERAHEME is often used in these patients as a supportive care therapeutic.
Consequently, hematology/oncology infusion centers represented 30 percent of
FERAHEME provider demand in the U.S. in 2010. FERAHEME has patent protection
through 2020, potentially longer with extensions.

FOLOTYN, a folate analogue metabolic inhibitor, was discovered by
Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, SRI International and Southern
Research Institute and developed by Allos Therapeutics. In September 2009, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for
FOLOTYN for use as a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed
or refractory PTCL. This indication is based on overall response rate.
Clinical benefit such as improvement in progression-free survival or overall
survival has not yet been demonstrated. FOLOTYN has been available to patients
in the U.S. since October 2009. An updated analysis of data from PROPEL, the
pivotal study of FOLOTYN in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL, was
published in the March 20, 2011 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology.
FOLOTYN has patent protection through 2017, potentially longer with
extensions.

Partnership Payments and Milestones

The combined company has the potential to earn up to $530.5 million in ex-U.S.
development and commercial milestone payments from established collaborations
and partnerships. Through its alliance with Takeda for FERAHEME in Europe and
other select territories, AMAG has the potential to earn up to $220 million by
meeting development and commercial milestones, including up to $33 million of
near-term potential milestones related to approvals and commercial launches in
the EU and Canada for the treatment of patients with IDA and CKD.

Under a collaboration agreement with Mundipharma, Allos retains full
commercialization rights for FOLOTYN in the U.S. and Canada, with Mundipharma
having exclusive rights to commercialize FOLOTYN in all other countries. Under
the collaboration, Allos received an upfront payment of $50 million in May
2011 and has the potential to earn regulatory and commercial progress- and
sales-dependent milestone payments of up to $310.5 million. Allos is also
entitled to receive tiered double-digit royalties based on net sales of
FOLOTYN within Mundipharmas licensed territories. Allos and Mundipharma will
jointly fund development costs, initially on a 60:40 basis, which will change
to a 50:50 basis if certain pre-defined milestones are achieved, including
approval of the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) currently under
review to market FOLOTYN in the European Union.

Quarterly Results

AMAG will announce its results for the second quarter 2011 on July 26, 2011.
AMAG currently expects total revenues for the second quarter to be between
$15.3 million and $15.5 million, including between $12.7 million and $12.9
million of net FERAHEME product revenues.

Allos will announce its results for the second quarter 2011 on August 4, 2011.
Allos currently expects FOLOTYN net product sales for the second quarter to be
approximately $11.0 million.

Both companies will provide further details on their respective quarterly
results during their scheduled quarterly conference calls.

Important Safety Information About FERAHEME

Indication and contraindications

FERAHEME  is indicated for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adult
patients with chronic kidney disease. FERAHEME  is contraindicated in patients
with known hypersensitivity to Feraheme or any of its components.

Warnings and precautions

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic-type reactions,
some of which have been life-threatening and fatal, have been reported in
patients receiving FERAHEME. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of
hypersensitivity during and after FERAHEME administration for at least 30
minutes and until clinically stable following completion of each
administration. Only administer the drug when personnel and therapies are
immediately available for the treatment of anaphylaxis and other
hypersensitivity reactions.  Anaphylactic type reactions, presenting with
cardiac/cardiorespiratory arrest, clinically significant hypotension, syncope,
and unresponsiveness have been reported in the post-marketing experience. In
clinical studies, serious hypersensitivity reactions were  reported in 0.2%
(3/1,726) of subjects receiving FERAHEME. Other adverse reactions potentially
associated with hypersensitivity (e.g., pruritus, rash, urticaria or wheezing)
were reported in  3.7% (63/1,726) of subjects. Severe adverse reactions of
clinically significant hypotension have been reported in the post-marketing
experience. In clinical studies, hypotension was reported in 1.9% (33/1,726)
of subjects, including three patients with serious hypotensive reactions.
Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension following each FERAHEME
injection. Excessive therapy with parenteral iron can lead to excess storage
of iron with the possibility of iatrogenic hemosiderosis. Patients should be
regularly monitored for hematologic response during parenteral iron therapy,
noting that lab assays may overestimate serum iron and transferrin bound iron
values in the 24 hours following administration of FERAHEME. As a
superparamagnetic iron oxide, FERAHEME  may transiently affect magnetic
resonance diagnostic imaging studies for up to 3 months following the last
FERAHEME  dose. FERAHEME will not affect X-ray, CT, PET, SPECT, ultrasound, or
nuclear imaging.

Adverse reactions

In clinical trials, the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in Feraheme
treated patients versus oral iron treated patients reported in ? 2% of chronic
kidney disease patients were diarrhea (4.0% vs. 8.2%), nausea (3.1% vs. 7.5%),
dizziness (2.6% vs. 1.8%), hypotension (2.5% vs. 0.4%), constipation (2.1% vs.
5.7%) and peripheral edema (2.0% vs. 3.2%). In clinical trials, adverse
reactions leading to treatment discontinuation and occurring in 2 or more
Feraheme treated patients included hypotension, infusion site swelling,
increased serum ferritin level, chest pain, diarrhea, dizziness, ecchymosis,
pruritus, chronic renal failure, and urticaria.

Post-marketing safety experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use
of FERAHEME. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a
population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate
their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The following serious adverse reactions have been reported from the
post-marketing spontaneous reports with FERAHEME: life-threatening
anaphylactic-type reactions, cardiac/cardiorespiratory arrest, clinically
significant hypotension, syncope, unresponsiveness, loss of consciousness,
tachycardia/rhythm abnormalities, angioedema, ischemic myocardial events,
congestive heart failure, pulse absent, and cyanosis. These adverse reactions
have occurred up to 30 minutes after the administration of FERAHEME
injection. Reactions have occurred following  the first dose or subsequent
doses of FERAHEME.

Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, SRI International and Southern
Research Institute and developed by Allos Therapeutics. In September 2009, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for

FOLOTYN has patent protection through 2017, potentially longer with
extensions.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Warnings and Precautions

FOLOTYN may suppress bone marrow function, manifested by thrombocytopenia,
neutropenia, and anemia. Monitor blood counts and omit or modify dose for
hematologic toxicities.

Mucositis may occur. If ?Grade 2 mucositis is observed, omit or modify dose.
Patients should be instructed to take folic acid and receive vitamin B[12] to
potentially reduce treatment-related hematological toxicity and mucositis.

Fatal dermatologic reactions may occur. Dermatologic reactions may be
progressive and increase in severity with further treatment. Patients with
dermatologic reactions should be monitored closely, and if severe, FOLOTYN
should be withheld or discontinued.

Tumor lysis syndrome may occur. Monitor patients and treat if needed.

FOLOTYN can cause fetal harm. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while being
treated with FOLOTYN and pregnant women should be informed of the potential
harm to the fetus.

Use caution and monitor patients when administering FOLOTYN to patients with
moderate to severe renal function impairment.

Elevated liver function test abnormalities may occur and require monitoring.
If liver function test abnormalities are ?Grade 3, omit or modify dose.

Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions were mucositis (70%), thrombocytopenia
(41%), nausea (40%), and fatigue (36%). The most common serious adverse events
are pyrexia, mucositis, sepsis, febrile neutropenia, dehydration, dyspnea, and
thrombocytopenia.

Use in Specific Patient Population

Nursing mothers should be advised to discontinue nursing or the drug, taking
into consideration the importance of the drug to the mother.

Drug Interactions

Co-administration of drugs subject to renal clearance (e.g., probenecid,
NSAIDs, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) may result in delayed renal
clearance.

Forward-Looking Statements

This communication contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant
to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. Terminology such as may, will, should, expects, intends,
plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, projects,
potential, continue, and other similar terminology or the negative of
these terms, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but
their absence does not mean that a particular statement is not
forward-looking. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual
results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward-looking
statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, involve
risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict, and are
based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove accurate.
Examples of such forward looking statements include Allos and AMAGs
expectations with respect to the synergies, costs and other anticipated
financial impacts of the proposed transaction; future financial and operating
results of the combined company; the combined company's plans, objectives,
expectations and intentions with respect to future operations; approval of the
proposed transaction by requisite stockholders; the satisfaction of the
closing conditions to the proposed transaction; and the timing of the
completion of the proposed transaction. In any forward-looking statement in
which AMAG or Allos expresses an expectation or belief as to future results,
such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a
reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the statement or
expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. The
following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ
materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: failure of
Allos or AMAG stockholders to approve the proposed transaction; the challenges
and costs of closing the proposed transaction, integrating the two companies,
restructuring the combined company; the possibility that the expected
synergies will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected
time period; the ability to retain key employees; and other economic,
business, competitive, and/or regulatory factors affecting the businesses of
Allos and AMAG generally, including those set forth in the filings of Allos
and AMAG with the Securities and Exchange Commission, especially in the Risk
Factors section of Allos Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
March 31, 2011 filed with the SEC on May 10, 2011, the Risk Factors section
of AMAGs Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011
filed with the SEC on May 9, 2011, and in Allos and AMAGs other periodic
reports and filings with the SEC. Allos and AMAG cautions investors not to
place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained herein. All
forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to
Allos and AMAG on the date hereof, and Allos and AMAG undertake no obligation
to revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or
circumstances after the date of this press release, except as required by law.
