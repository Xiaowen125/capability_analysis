Business Wire

SAN FRANCISCO & STUTTGART, Germany -- October 24, 2013

McKesson Corporation [NYSE: MCK] (?McKesson?), a leading North American
healthcare services and information technology company, and Celesio AG [ISIN
DE000CLS1001] (?Celesio?), a leading international wholesale and retail
company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and
healthcare sectors, announced today that McKesson has signed an agreement to
acquire a majority stake in Celesio for ?23 per share and to launch parallel
voluntary public tender offers for the remaining publicly-traded shares and
outstanding convertible bonds of Celesio. The offer price of ?23 per share
represents a 39% premium over the three-month volume weighted average price
prior to the market speculation that began on October 8, 2013. The total
transaction, including the assumption of Celesio?s outstanding debt, is valued
at approximately $8.3 billion(?6.1 billion)*.

McKesson and Celesio will combine to form a global leader in healthcare
services with deep expertise in delivering solutions to pharmacies,
manufacturers, patients and other customers. The transaction brings together
the strength of two leaders with complementary geographic footprints, shared
values and a heritage of trusted healthcare services ? through pharmaceutical
wholesaling, community pharmacy care and information technology ? dating back
approximately 180 years.

The combined company will be one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and
providers of logistics and services in the healthcare sector worldwide and
expects to deliver:

  *ˇExceptional value to customers through increased supply chain efficiency
    and enhanced global sourcing;
  *ˇGlobal distribution and logistics capabilities that bring new value and
    services to manufacturing partners;
  *ˇA broad array of innovative technology and business services; and
  *ˇOperating best practices across an extensive distribution network on three
    continents.

?The combination of McKesson and Celesio will create a leading global
healthcare services platform that will advance our customers? ability to
deliver better, more efficient healthcare solutions,? said John H. Hammergren,
chairman and chief executive officer, McKesson Corporation. ?The healthcare
industry is evolving rapidly, marked by convergence between segments and
increased globalization. With today?s announcement, we will bring together the
strengths and expertise of each company to address global healthcare
challenges.?

Mr. Hammergren added: ?We are looking forward to working with Celesio?s
management team and employees to provide our customers with more efficient
delivery of healthcare products and services around the world. Our customers ?
from community pharmacies to major hospital networks ? will benefit from the
increased scale, supply chain expertise and sourcing capabilities of the
combined company, together with enhanced access to innovative technology and
business services.?

After completion of the transaction, McKesson and Celesio expect to maintain
their own brands and continue to support customers through existing channels.

?The agreements announced today with McKesson represent an exciting new
chapter for Celesio,? said Marion Helmes, speaker of the Celesio AG management
board and chief financial officer. ?This transaction is about growth, it
positions our operations for success and brings benefits for all Celesio
stakeholders. This combination allows two market leaders with complementary
geographic footprints to work together in an increasingly global market
segment.?

Ms. Helmes added: ?Both companies have a long history of leadership in the
pharmaceutical wholesale and retail pharmacy industries, and our mission and
values are very similar to McKesson?s. We believe that our employees, all of
whom are passionate about the important role they play in the delivery of
quality healthcare services, will benefit from being part of an even stronger
international group.?

The operations of Celesio will be part of McKesson?s Distribution Solutions
segment, headed by Paul C. Julian, executive vice president and group
president, who commented: ?We are looking forward to welcoming the management
team and employees of Celesio. McKesson and Celesio share a culture of respect
for our customers and for the employees who serve them every day. The business
leaders in McKesson and Celesio have built relationships with customers over
many years and have a deep understanding of their own unique markets. We look
forward to supporting Celesio and their business leaders as they implement
their currently planned strategy for growth, and ultimately aligning our
organizations more closely in the areas where we can deliver further value for
our customers and manufacturing partners.?

The combined group is expected to have annual revenues in excess of $150
billion(?111 billion)*, approximately 81,500 employees worldwide and
operations in more than 20 countries. McKesson and Celesio deliver to
approximately 120,000 pharmacy and hospital locations on a daily basis in the
U.S., Canada, Europe and Brazil, including more than 11,000 pharmacies that
are either owned or are part of a strategic banner or franchise network of
community pharmacies.

Transaction structure

Under the terms of a share purchase agreement between McKesson and Franz
Haniel & Cie. GmbH (?Haniel?), the majority shareholder in Celesio, McKesson
has agreed to acquire Haniel?s stake in Celesio, currently representing 50.01%
of the total outstanding shares of the company. The share purchase agreement
has been approved by McKesson?s Board of Directors and Haniel?s Supervisory
Board.

McKesson has also entered into a business combination agreement with Celesio
which outlines the key parameters that will facilitate the combination of both
companies and has been approved by McKesson?s Board of Directors and Celesio?s
Supervisory Board. The Management Board and the Supervisory Board of Celesio
welcome the takeover offer and the members of the Management Board intend to
accept the takeover offer for any Celesio shares held by them.

McKesson will launch parallel tender offers for Celesio?s publicly-traded
shares at ?23 per share and its outstanding convertible bonds at a price
corresponding to the value of the underlying shares implied by a ?23 per share
offer price, which equals ?53,117.78 per bond for Celesio?s convertible bond
due 2014 (principal amount of ?50,000) and ?120,798.32 per bond for Celesio?s
convertible bond due 2018 (principal amount of ?100,000). McKesson expects the
tender offers to commence during McKesson?s fiscal third quarter of 2014,
ending December 31, 2013, and conclude in McKesson?s fiscal fourth quarter of
2014, but no earlier than January 17, 2014.

The share purchase from Haniel and the tender offers are subject to certain
closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the acquisition by
McKesson of a minimum of 75% of the shares of Celesio on a fully diluted
basis.

Upon the successful completion of the tender offers, McKesson will consolidate
the financial results of Celesio, and McKesson?s earnings will reflect its
proportionate share of Celesio?s earnings. McKesson expects to complete the
tender offers in its fiscal fourth quarter of 2014, ending March 31, 2014, and
expects to complete the required steps to obtain operational control of
Celesio during McKesson?s fiscal 2015.

Financial details

By the fourth year following the completion of the required steps to obtain
operational control of Celesio, McKesson expects to realize annual synergies
between $275 million and $325 million.

McKesson expects to fund a portion of the transaction with cash and has put a
bridge financing facility in place to fund the balance of the transaction. The
permanent financing structure will be determined by the timing and the number
of Celesio shares and convertible bonds tendered in the tender offers.
McKesson is committed to maintaining its status as an investment grade rated
company in the final permanent financing structure.

McKesson expects the transaction to be $1.00 to $1.20 accretive to adjusted
earnings per share in the first twelve months following the successful
completion of the tender offers. The estimated range of accretion assumes
McKesson achieves 100% ownership of the shares of Celesio at the conclusion of
the tender offers. The final range of accretion will be dependent on the
actual result of the tender offers, the permanent financing structure, and the
estimated operating results of the business.

Conference call details

John Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer of McKesson, will
provide more information on the transaction on the company?s previously
scheduled earnings call on October 24, 2013 at 8:30am Eastern Time (5:30am
Pacific Time / 2:30pm Central European Time). The dial-in number for
individuals wishing to participate on the call is +1 719-234-7317. Erin
Lampert, senior vice president, Investor Relations, is the leader of the call,
and the password to join the call is ?McKesson.? The conference call will also

"Jos. A. Bank Confirms Proposal to Acquire Men's Wearhouse for $48 Per Share in
Cash

  *ˇProposal Would Provide Men's Wearhouse Shareholders a Significant Premium

  *ˇ$2.3 Billion, All-Cash Transaction Would Create Leading Men's Apparel
    Designer, Manufacturer and Retailer in the U.S.

  *ˇAcquisition Would be Immediately and Significantly Accretive to Jos. A.
    Bank Earnings

  *ˇGolden Gate Capital to Partner with Jos. A. Bank

HAMPSTEAD, Md., Oct. 9, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In response to inquiries
following news reports of discussions with The Men's Wearhouse, Inc. (NYSE:MW)
about a possible business combination, Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, Inc.
(Nasdaq:JOSB) today confirmed that it has made a non-binding proposal to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of Men's Wearhouse for $48 per share in
cash, representing a total equity value of approximately $2.3 billion, in a
negotiated transaction. The proposal represents an approximate 42% premium to
the closing price of Men's Wearhouse common stock on September 17, 2013, the
day before Jos. A. Bank made the proposal to Men's Wearhouse in a telephone
call and follow-up letter, which is below, from Robert N. Wildrick, Chairman
of the Board of Jos. A. Bank, to Douglas S. Ewert, Chief Executive Officer of
Men's Wearhouse. Men's Wearhouse has advised Jos. A. Bank that it is reviewing
the proposal.

""We are hopeful that Men's Wearhouse's Board will accept our proposal,"" said
Mr. Wildrick, Chairman of the Board of Jos. A. Bank. ""We believe Men's
Wearhouse's shareholders would want their Board to explore with us the
immediate and certain value they would receive in a transaction. We have
always admired Men's Wearhouse and believe these two great companies, when
combined, will create continued growth and sustainable value for our
shareholders, greatly enhanced benefits for our customers, and exciting
opportunities for our employees.""

The transaction is expected to be funded by a combination of cash on Jos. A.
Bank's balance sheet, new equity capital and debt financing. The new equity
will be provided by Golden Gate Capital, a leading private equity firm.
ˇGoldman, Sachs & Co. has informed Jos. A. Bank that, subject to customary
terms and conditions, it is highly confident that the debt financing can be
obtained in the capital markets.

""Our all-cash proposal would deliver a substantial premium to Men's Wearhouse
shareholders and create, in our view, the leading men's apparel and sportswear
designer, manufacturer and retailer in the U.S. In addition to capturing
significant synergies, we believe that a combination would bring together our
complementary capabilities to better serve our customers. We are pleased to
have the support and participation of Golden Gate Capital, a leading investor
in the retail space, partnering with us in this transaction, and look forward
to benefitting from their considerable experience as we grow the combined
company,"" concluded Mr. Wildrick.

""We are pleased to have been selected by Jos. A. Bank to partner on this
exciting potential combination of the leading brands and top management teams
in men's retailing. We see a natural and highly complementary fit that creates
a great opportunity for these companies to deliver impressive growth as a
result of the transaction,"" said Josh Olshansky, Managing Director at Golden
Gate Capital.ˇ

Jos. A. Bank believes the proposed transaction will allow Jos. A. Bank's
management to leverage its core competencies and achieve sustainable growth
and value creation for Jos. A. Bank shareholders while providing a significant
premium to Men's Wearhouse shareholders. The combined company will capitalize
on the relative strengths of each business, offering a larger platform from
which both brands can optimize and expand their real estate footprint,
strengthen their merchandising and sourcing capabilities, and enhance their
multi-channel strategies in a rapidly evolving retail landscape.

Jos. A. Bank further noted that this transaction would provide unique benefits
to Men's Wearhouse's shareholders due to the significant overlap in the
shareholder composition of the two companies.ˇ In addition to receiving a full
cash premium for their Men's Wearhouse shares, Men's Wearhouse shareholders
who are also shareholders of Jos. A. Bank would have the opportunity to
participate in the value creation resulting from the combination.

Since the current management team started in November 1999, Jos. A. Bank has
an exceptional track record of generating long-term growth and shareholder
value: its share price has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 30%, vs.
a 1.6% annualized return of the S&P 500, and ahead of nearly all specialty
retail peers. During the same period, Jos. A. Bank's market capitalization has
appreciated over 4,300% compared to an approximately 25% increase for the S&P
500.

Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Financo, LLC are serving as financial advisors and
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Guilfoil Petzall & Shoemake,
L.L.C. are serving as legal advisors to Jos. A. Bank.ˇ

Jos. A. Bank's proposal is a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest
to acquire the outstanding shares of Men's Wearhouse, and was submitted based
on the understanding that it is not an offer that is capable of being
accepted, and that there will be no binding agreement between Jos. A. Bank and
Men's Wearhouse or any commitment or obligation on Jos. A. Bank or Men's
Wearhouse with respect to Jos. A. Bank's proposal or a possible transaction
unless and until a definitive agreement is executed by Jos. A. Bank and Men's
Wearhouse.ˇ Jos. A. Bank's proposal is subject to a number of conditions,
including, among others, Jos. A. Bank's satisfaction with the results of its
due diligence review of Men's Wearhouse in Jos. A. Bank's sole discretion,
negotiation and execution of a mutually satisfactory merger agreement,
approval of a transaction by Jos. A. Bank's Board of Directors, and
negotiating and entering into satisfactory definitive equity and debt
financing agreements.

To Access Further Information About the Proposed Transaction:

Jos. A. Bank has posted on its website a presentation that provides further

Text of the September 18, 2013 Letter Sent to the Chief Executive Officer of
Men's Wearhouse:

  September 18, 2013

  Douglas S. Ewert
  Chief Executive Officer
  The Men's Wearhouse, Inc.
  6380 Rogerdale Road
  Houston, TXˇ 77072

  Dear Doug:

  It was a pleasure speaking with you today ? thank you for taking my call.ˇ
  We have been in the same industry for many years, and it was nice to finally
  meet you, if only by phone.ˇ I have always had a tremendous amount of
  respect and admiration for your company, your people, the quality of your
  brand and the success of your business model. In many ways, this foundation
  of respect for the business and talent within your organization is what led
  us to consider and now present you with the proposal I described on the
  phone.ˇ As we discussed, on behalf of Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, Inc. (""Jos. A.
  Bank""), I am pleased to send this letter summarizing our proposal to acquire
  The Men's Wearhouse, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Men's Wearhouse"") in an
  all-cash acquisition of 100% of the Company's outstanding shares (the
  ""Transaction"").

  We believe that Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank are ideal partners ? the
  strategic wisdom of this Transaction is compelling.ˇ By combining our two
  companies, we can together create the best men's apparel and sportswear
  designer, manufacturer and retailer in the U.S. We believe that a
  combination would leverage and enhance Jos. A. Bank's and Men's Wearhouse's
  complementary market positioning because our two companies can better serve
  all customers with an impressive portfolio of branded men's apparel and
  sportswear at various price points. In addition to capturing operating
  synergies, the combined company would offer a larger platform from which we
  can together optimize and expand our real estate footprint, strengthen our
  merchandising and sourcing capabilities, and enhance our omni-channel
  strategies in a rapidly evolving retail landscape.

  From a professional standpoint, the management and employees of both
  companies should find the combination compelling as well.ˇ The philosophy of
  Jos. A. Bank has always been to provide opportunities for the most qualified
  of our managers and associates. We also believe in a strong corporate
  culture where employees are treated with respect and offered a chance to
  excel at their jobs.ˇ After all, we are in a service business where our
  sales associates and field personnel are ultimately responsible for the
  quality and success of our customer interactions. Our approach to managing
  our human capital will not change if we combine our two great companies.

  Please find below an outline of our proposal to share with your Board of
  Directors:

  Proposed Purchase Price:ˇ Based on publicly available information, our
  knowledge of the Company and subject to completing due diligence, we are
  prepared to propose $48 per share in cash for all of the outstanding shares
  of the Company. This valuation represents a 42.4% premium for your
  shareholders over yesterday's closing price, a 34.6% premium to the 30-day
  volume-weighted average per share closing price and a 17.8% premium to the
  Company 52-week and 5-year high. Our valuation implies an 8.4x multiple of
  twelve-month EBITDA ($282 million) as of the Company's most recent quarter
  ended August 3, 2013.

  Financing:ˇ We have spent considerable time and energy arranging the
  financing necessary to complete this Transaction.ˇ Funds will be obtained
  from a combination of approximately $300 million in cash from Jos. A. Bank,
  new equity capital and debt financing. A portion of the purchase price will
  be provided by funds managed by Golden Gate Capital, a leading private
  equity firm.ˇ Golden Gate Capital will purchase $250 million of Jos. A. Bank
  equity to facilitate the Transaction. We have chosen Golden Gate Capital to
  be our partner because of their in-depth knowledge of the retail industry,
  prior success in retail and consumer transactions, and track record of
  partnering with public companies. In addition, Goldman, Sachs & Co. has

the company to further diversify its portfolio. The company expects to
capitalize on the material technology capabilities, engineered components and
world-class tooling products of ATI's Tungsten Materials Business to expand
its presence in the aerospace and energy markets.ˇˇ

The acquisition will advance Kennametal's core strategy that seeks to
diversify the company's tungsten sourcing to balance supplies, costs and
access to raw materials, including those produced from recycled products.ˇ The
ability of ATI's Tungsten Materials Business to produce critical materials
from recovered tooling and scrap will enhance Kennametal's material sourcing
and development capabilities to support the company's growth initiatives. The
acquisition accelerates Kennametal's previously announced plans to expand
capacity and develop an advanced tungsten carbide recycling facility in the
United States to serve global markets. The company also estimates that this
will reduce planned capital expenditures by approximately $30 million to $35
million and expects to achieve economy of scale six to eight years earlier
than prior projections.

In addition, the acquisition will further augment Kennametal's tooling
portfolio in the areas of metal cutting and metal finishing technologies,
through brands such as Stellram Products, Garryson Products and Landis
Products.ˇ

The acquisition is expected to generate significant synergies. The company
forecasts potential annual run-rate cost synergies ranging from $30 million to
$40 million, which it anticipates will be realized via productivity
improvements, operational efficiencies and raw-material cost benefits.ˇ
Kennametal also plans to pursue revenue synergies by extending the sales of
ATI's Tungsten Materials Business globally through its existing sales
channels, while building further on its strategic talent and technologies.

The transaction is structured as both an asset and stock purchase with
Kennametal benefiting from the ""step-up"" in the tax basis of the acquired
assets and the resulting tax deduction. Management estimates the cash tax
benefit of the step-up to have a net present value of approximately $60
million to $70 million.

Kennametal plans to fund the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand
and available borrowings under its existing revolving credit facility. The
company expects the acquisition to be neutral to earnings for the remainder of
its fiscal year 2014. Adjusted for the estimated annual run-rate synergies and
tax asset, the implied acquisition multiple represents approximately 7.2x
EBITDA based on historical earnings.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Kennametal
on the transaction.

Webcast

Kennametal will discuss the transaction in a live webcast at 8:30 a.m. Eastern
Time today.ˇ The related slides and audio replays of the event will be
available on the company's website, www.kennametal.com, through October 16,
2013.ˇ Once on the homepage, select ""About Us"", ""Investor Relations"" and then

days ended Oct. 18, 2013. The board of directors of Symmetricom unanimously

of highly precise timekeeping technologies and solutions that enable next
generation data, voice, mobile and video networks and services. It provides
timekeeping in GPS satellites, national time references, and national power

""The acquisition of Symmetricom will create the largest and most complete
timing portfolio in the industry today,"" stated James J. Peterson, Microsemi
president and chief executive officer. ""From source to synchronization to
distribution, Microsemi will offer an end to end timing solution for an
expanded range of markets, driving increased dollar content opportunity and
revenue growth.""

""The acquisition of Symmetricom by Microsemi will create a powerful
combination,"" said Elizabeth Fetter, Symmetricom's chief executive officer. ""I
believe Microsemi is the ideal company to leverage Symmetricom's technology
and capabilities further into the communications market along with the scale
to accelerate the adoption of the company's innovative new chip scale atomic

Microsemi expects significant synergies from this immediately accretive
transaction. Based on current assumptions, Microsemi expects the acquisition
to be $0.22 to $0.25 accretive in its first full calendar year ending December
2014.

Microsemi reaffirms its fiscal fourth quarter guidance included in its fiscal
third quarter earnings release issued on July 25, 2013. Microsemi currently
intends to announce its fiscal fourth quarter results on Nov. 7, 2013. Further
details will be forthcoming.

Tender Offer and Closing

Under the terms of the definitive acquisition agreement, Microsemi will
commence a cash tender offer to acquire Symmetricom's outstanding shares of
common stock at $7.18 per share, net to each holder in cash. Upon satisfaction
of the conditions to the tender offer and after such time as all shares
tendered in the tender offer are accepted for payment, the agreement provides
for the parties to effect, as promptly as practicable, a merger which would
result in all shares not tendered in the tender offer being converted into the
right to receive $7.18 per share in cash. The tender offer is subject to
customaryˇ conditions, including the tender of at least a majority of the
fully-diluted shares of Symmetricom's common stock and certain regulatory
approvals,ˇ including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and is expected
to close in Microsemi's fiscal first quarter, ending Dec. 29, 2013. No
approval of the stockholders of Microsemi is required in connection with the
proposed transaction. Terms of the agreement were unanimously approved by the
boards of directors of both Microsemi and Symmetricom.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Symmetricom may solicit superior
proposals from third parties for a ""go shop"" period that extends through Nov.
8, 2013. It is not anticipated that any developments will be disclosed with
regard to this process unless and until Symmetricom's board of directors makes
a decision to pursue a potential superior proposal. Jefferies LLC, which is
acting as Symmetricom's financial adviser, will assist Symmetricom with
Symmetricom's go-shop process. There are no guarantees that this process will
result in a superior proposal. ˇThe merger agreement provides Microsemi with a
customary right to match a superior proposal. The agreement also provides for
certain termination fees payable to Microsemi in connection with the
termination of the agreement in certain circumstances.

Jefferies LLC is acting as financial adviser and Latham & Watkins LLP is
acting as legal adviser to Symmetricom. Morgan Stanley provided a fairness
opinion to Microsemi and O'Melveny & Myers LLP is acting as legal adviser to
Microsemi.ˇˇ

potential benefits of the merger, including the potentially accretive and
synergistic benefits, Microsemi's revenue and earnings guidance, and any other
statements of belief or about the Microsemi's plans, beliefs or expectations.
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ

acceptance, gross margins and operational and other cost synergies; costs
associated with the merger, tender offer and financing; the unsuccessful
completion of the tender offer; matters arising in connection with the
parties' efforts to comply with and satisfy applicable regulatory approvals
and closing conditions relating to the transaction; increased competition and
technological changes in the industries in which Microsemi and Symmetricom
compete; Microsemi's reliance on government contracts for a portion of its
sales, including impacts of the recent federal government shutdown;
Microsemi's failure to continue to move up the value chain in its customer
offerings; continued negative or worsening worldwide economic conditions or
market instability; downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry;
intense competition in the semiconductor industry and resultant downward price
pressure; inability to develop new technologies and products to satisfy
changes in customer demand or the development by the company's competitors of
products that decrease the demand for Microsemi's products; unfavorable or
declining conditions in end markets; inability of Microsemi's compound
semiconductor products to compete successfully with silicon-based products;
production delays related to new compound semiconductors; variability of the

litigation, or any matters involving contingent liabilities or other claims;
the uncertainty of litigation, the costs and expenses of litigation, the
potential material adverse effect litigation could have on Microsemi's
business and results of operations if an adverse determination in litigation
is made, and the time and attention required of management to attend to
litigation; uncertainty as to the future profitability of acquired businesses,
and delays in the realization of, or the failure to realize, any accretion
from acquisition transactions; any circumstances that adversely impact the end
markets of acquired businesses; and difficulties in closing or disposing of
operations or assets or transferring work, assets or inventory from one plant
to another. In addition to these factors and any other factors mentioned

future filings. The forward-looking statements included in this release speak
only as of the date hereof, and Microsemi does not undertake any obligation to
update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or
circumstances. Guidance is provided only on a non-GAAP basis due to the
inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of certain items that

estimate the excluded items are not accessible or estimable on a

"              Vonage Holdings Corp. to Acquire Vocalocity, Inc.

Accelerates Entry into Rapidly Growing Market for Hosted VoIP Communications
for Small and Medium Businesses

PR Newswire

HOLMDEL, N.J., Oct. 10, 2013

HOLMDEL, N.J., Oct. 10, 2013 /PRNewswire/ --ˇVonage Holdings Corp. (NYSE: VG),
a leading provider of communications services connecting people through
cloud-connected devices worldwide, has entered into a definitive agreement to
acquire privately-held Vocalocity, Inc. (""Vocalocity""), an industry-leading
Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of cloud-based communication services to
Small and Medium Businesses (""SMBs"").

Vonage will acquire Vocalocity for $130 million, including $105 million in
cash and $25 million in Vonage common stock. The transaction is expected to be
accretive to adjusted Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")^1 and on an EBITDA^1 multiple
basis in 2015.

Vocalocity is one of the fastest growing providers in the SMB hosted VoIP
market. During the first half of 2013, Vocalocity had revenue of $28 million
and growing, implying an annual run rate of greater than $56 million. ˇFirst
half 2013 revenues were 39% higher than the same period in the prior year.
Vocalocity was EBITDA^1 and free cash flow^1 positive during this period.ˇ
Vocalocity ended the second quarter with 21,000 customers.

The total SMB market for voice service in North America is $15 billion and 32
million lines.ˇ Vocalocity has focused on companies with 20 or fewer
employees, which represents more than 60% of the total market.ˇ The long-term
opportunity for growth in this segment is substantial given that 85% of SMBs
still purchase voice service from traditional carriers at rates that are
frequently 40-50% higher than those of Vocalocity.ˇ The SMB hosted VoIP market
is forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 27.5% over the next 5
years^2.

""Entry into the SMB segment is a key element of the growth strategy we
outlined last year,"" said Marc Lefar, Vonage Chief Executive Officer.
""Vocalocity accelerates our entry with a comprehensive, high-quality product
suite and scalable platform. In addition, Vocalocity's software orientation,
customer focus and innovative approach are a natural fit with our culture.""

Vocalocity CEO Wain Kellum commented, ""As business VoIP moves from the early
adopter phase to the mainstream, a Vocalocity and Vonage combination delivers
the scale, quality and feature set to best serve customers and create
phenomenal opportunities for growth.ˇI am impressed with what Vonage has
built, and look forward to joining the team.""

Upon closing, Mr. Kellum, will join Vonage as President, Business Services,
and become a member of the Company's senior leadership team.

Transaction Terms and Anticipated Synergies

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved
by the boards of directors of Vonage and Vocalocity, shareholders of
Vocalocity will receive $105 million in cash and $25 million in Vonage common
stock for total consideration of $130 million, subject to customary closing
adjustments.ˇ A portion of the purchase price will be deposited into escrow to
partially secureˇVonage's indemnification rights under the Merger Agreement in
respect of any breach of Vocalocity's representations, warranties or covenants
as well as certain other indemnifiable matters.ˇ The transaction is expected
to close in the fourth quarter of 2013, subject to customary closing
conditions.

Given the similarities of the businesses and their common use of SIP-based
VoIP technology to enable communication services, Vonage expects to achieve
synergies from network operations and the use of technology for serving
customers.ˇˇSynergies in 2015 are estimated to be recurring and in the high
single-digit million dollar range.

Evercore served as financial advisor and Weil, Gotshal and Manges as legal
counsel to Vonage in connection with this transaction. William Blair and
Company served as the financial advisor and DLA Piper as the legal counsel to
Vocalocity.

Vonage is financing the transaction through $30 million of cash from the
balance sheet and $75 million from its credit facility.ˇ The Company will
continue to execute on its balanced approach to capital allocation and expects
to complete its $100 million share repurchase program by the end of 2014 as
planned.ˇ

HOUSTON -- December 9, 2013

DXP Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: DXPE) and B27, LLC, principally controlled by
Champlain Capital Partners, L.P., announced today that they entered into a
definitive agreement pursuant to which DXP will acquire all of the equity
securities and interests of B27, LLC at a purchase price of approximately $285
million. Closing is anticipated during the first quarter of 2014, subject to
the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing
conditions. Signing of the definitive agreement occurred on December 9, 2013.

B27, LLC (?B27?) was founded in 1978 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas.
B27 is a global supplier of sophisticated pump and integrated flow control
solutions serving the oil & gas, power generation, air quality and other
industrial markets. B27 has approximately 342 employees with projected sales
and adjusted EBITDA of $198 million and $35 million, respectively for fiscal
year 2013. Adjusted EBITDA was calculated as income before tax, plus interest,
plus depreciation and amortization, plus non-recurring items that will not
continue after the completion of the acquisition. Additional B27 information
can be found on B27?s websites at www.BestPumpworks.com and
www.IFSolutions.com.

?We believe DXP is ideally suited to realize the full potential of B27?s

companies,? said David Little, Chairman, President and CEO of DXP. ?B27 is a
great company with high caliber people and a culture that is very similar to

equipment distributor with operations reaching as far as the Middle East and
Africa. We look forward to working with our suppliers to provide complete
solutions for all our pump customers, whether they are looking for local
expertise or multiple site integrated solutions. The addition of B27
complements DXP?s breadth of technical products and services. B27 is another
exciting combination for DXP, especially, on the heels of the Natpro
transaction we closed earlier this year. As we continue to be customer driven,
we have grown DXP?s Rotating Equipment product division to over $700 million
in revenue and we look forward to the division?s continued growth.?

Kent Yee, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, further stated, ?The
combination of DXP and B27 follows a thorough due diligence process and is
fully consistent with our strategy of being a 'one-stop' source for all our
customers? rotating equipment needs. We expect this acquisition will
accelerate our growth plans and enhance value for DXP shareholders. We are
very excited to welcome the talented and hardworking employees of B27 to the
DXP team. We are especially enthusiastic to now offer a global offering in
rotating equipment within key markets. We look forward to growing B27. This
transaction will be positive for B27 and DXP?s customers, employees and
shareholders.?

Mr. Little concluded, ?Our two companies share a strong culture of
entrepreneurship and a focus on servicing the customer. I look forward to
bringing the talented people of B27 and DXP together as we continue to fulfill
our commitment to meet all our customer needs.?

""These acquisitions add high quality acreage in the heart of the Bakken and
Three Forks play, providing incremental scale to our premier position in the
Williston Basin,"" said Thomas B. Nusz, Oasis' Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer.ˇ ""As we enter full development mode, our size and scale will continue
to drive growth, efficiencies and shareholder value.ˇ We believe that these
transactions are consistent with our growth strategy, as we deliver
incremental value without diluting our high quality asset base.""

Mr. Nusz added, ""We are currently operating 11 rigs and the sellers are
operating two rigs, which we believe keeps acquisition production levels
relatively flat through the end of 2013.ˇ We expect to accelerate development
across our overall combined position next year, increasing to 15 to 16
operated rigs by the end of 2014.ˇ As of June 30, 2013, we had approximately

by almost 50% to 492,000 net acres.ˇ We are not only excited about the
near-term value of this deal, but the outlook over the long-term is extremely
compelling.""

Borrowing Base Redetermination

Oasis also announced today that the lenders under its revolving credit
facility completed their regular semi-annual redetermination of the borrowing
base, resulting in an increase to the borrowing base from $1,250 million to
$1,500 million, based on Oasis' reserves as of June 30, 2013 on a stand-alone
basis.ˇ Additionally, Oasis added four new lenders to the bank group. ˇAs of
September 4, 2013, Oasis had $100.0 million of borrowings under its revolving
credit facility and $5.2 million of letters of credit, which reduces the
borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility. As of September 4, 2013,
the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $198.6 million.

Oasis signed a purchase and sale agreement to acquire certain assets,
including approximately 136,000 net acres in and around its position in North

net acres have no depth limitations.ˇ Oasis also signed three other unrelated
purchase and sale agreements to acquire certain assets in East Nesson (the
""East Nesson Acquisitions"") totaling 25,000 net acres, in the aggregate, for

conditions. ˇThe effective date for the West Williston Acquisition is April 1,

PR Newswire

NEW YORK and PHOENIX, Oct. 23, 2013

NEW YORK and PHOENIX, Oct. 23, 2013ˇ /PRNewswire/ --ˇAmerican Realty Capital
Properties, Inc. (""ARCP"") (NASDAQ: ARCP) and Cole Real Estate Investments,
Inc. (""Cole"") (NYSE: COLE) announced today that they have signed a definitive
agreement to merge the two companies (the ""Merger Agreement""). The transaction
is valued at $11.2 billion and will create the largest net lease REIT with an
enterprise value of $21.5 billion. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously
approved by the board of directors of each company and is subject to customary
closing conditions, including stockholder votes by both companies. ARCP has
secured $2.75 billion of fully committed financing from Barclays in connection
with the transaction, which is expected to close in the first half of 2014.ˇ

Transaction Highlights

  oˇAFFO Growth: Updated ARCP AFFO pro forma 2014 guidance of $1.13 to $1.19
    per share, as described in Annex A; target payout ratio of 85% to 90%.
  oˇDividend Increase: ARCP dividend per share on closing increases to $1.00.
  oˇSignificant Deleveraging: ARCP net debt to EBITDA ratio declines from 9.1x
    to 7.7x by year end 2014.
  oˇExpense Synergies: $70 million of year one expense synergies expected.
  oˇScale and Competiveness: 64% larger than the closest comparable net lease
    REIT. Size and scale create operating and revenue efficiencies, including
    lower cost of capital, superior growth opportunities and higher investor
    returns.
  oˇPortfolio Quality: Superior diversification by asset type, tenancy,
    industry and geography; 47% investment grade tenancy; 99% occupied; 11
    years remaining average lease term.
  oˇOptimization of Core Capabilities: In addition to the durability provided
    by the single tenant net lease portfolio, the multi-tenant retail
    properties coupled with the ""vintage"" (mid-term) net leased properties
    provide significant rent growth potential.
  oˇCost of Capital Advantages: ARCP's investment grade rating allows for
    significantly lower cost of financing, which is highly accretive to its
    overall corporate earnings.
  oˇIncreased Institutional Coverage: Transaction positions ARCP for potential
    inclusion in the S&P 500.

Best-in-Class Property Portfolio
As a result of the merger, ARCP is expected to solidify sector leadership
among net lease REITs with a pro forma combined company portfolio of 3,732
properties leased to over 600 tenants occupying over 100 million square feet
in 49 states and Puerto Rico. More than 47% of annualized rents will be from
investment grade tenants. ARCP will be 99% occupied with an average remaining
lease term of 11 years.ˇ Enterprise value will total more than $21.5 billion,
64% more than its next largest competitor.

Additionally, Cole's Private Capital Management business, a premier net lease
REIT sponsor, will remain intact and continue to provide meaningful revenue
contribution to ARCP.

Terms of Merger Agreement
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Cole will merge with and into a
wholly owned subsidiary of ARCP. Cole stockholders may elect to receive 1.0929
shares of ARCP common stock (reflecting a fixed exchange ratio) or $13.82 cash
for each share of Cole common stock. In the event elections for payment in
cash exceed 20% of Cole's outstanding shares, such elections would be
prorated. ARCP's offer is valued at $14.59 per Cole common share based on the
fixed exchange ratio of 1.0929 and ARCP's closing price of $13.35 on October
22, 2013. The offer price represents a premium of 13.8% based on Cole's
closing price on October 22, 2013 of $12.82. Shares of ARCP common stock
issued to Cole stockholders are expected to be registered, fully tradable,
listed on the NASDAQ and not subject to any ""lockup."" For U.S. federal income
tax purposes, the transaction is intended to be tax free for Cole
stockholders, except with respect to cash received. ARCP will increase its
annualized dividend $0.06 to $1.00 per share upon the close of the merger.

Further, in connection with the closing of the merger, two of Cole's existing
independent directors will become additional independent directors of ARCP,
subject to approval by ARCP's current board.

Comments by Senior Management
Commenting on the transaction, ARCP's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
Nicholas S. Schorsch said, ""Today it is my great pleasure to announce the
merger of two leading U.S. real estate companies, American Realty Capital
Properties and Cole Real Estate Investments. As a result, ARCP will become the
largest net lease REIT and the new industry leader. We benefit by uniting not
only two exceptional real estate portfolios, but also by joining forces with
Cole's world-class management team. Going forward, we will benefit greatly
from the executive leadership currently at Cole Real Estate Investments.""

Mr. Schorsch continued, ""Both companies share the same vision, namely to drive
value for stockholders by placing their interests ahead of our own, aligning
pay with performance, and reporting fully and transparently. We share the same
disciplined investment philosophy and investment processes, which are focused
on investment grade tenancy, long lease durations, a strong diversified tenant
base, and a mix of property type and geography. ARCP and Cole both have
histories of driving tremendous growth.ˇ By leveraging our successful track
records, our complementary businesses and highly skilled professionals, we are
confident that we will be well-positioned to achieve continued growth. This
merger represents a new beginning for former competitors, and we look forward
to uniting two of the industry's most talented organizations. Far more can be
accomplished by these two great companies working together than either one
could have hoped to achieve independently.""

Christopher H. Cole, founder and Executive Chairman of Cole Real Estate
Investments, stated, ""We are pleased to have reached this agreement with ARCP,
which we believe provides compelling value and significant equity upside
potential for Cole stockholders at a time when we believe the industry is
consolidating.ˇ My decision and the decision of our board to merge the
companies under Nick's leadership is entirely forward-thinking, namely, our
two companies are far better and more powerful together than apart; our union
provides immediate and obvious benefits of size, scale and diversification.ˇ
This transaction represents a major step in achieving our goal of creating the
premier real estate company that delivers best-in-class long-term results to
our clients. Nick and his team have demonstrated the ability to grow their net
lease business rapidly, yet deliberately, realizing value for their
stockholders with every carefully mapped step. Our collective portfolio of
properties and combined human capital will position the company for outsized
growth moving ahead. As I step away from the company which I built and bears
my name, I am very proud of and will miss the outstanding people who have
helped me construct our world-class enterprise.ˇ I am very proud of our
exceptional team and am confident that they will become an integral part of
the ARCP family.""

Cole's Chief Executive Officer, Marc Nemer added, ""This transaction brings
together two high quality property portfolios managed by talented
professionals serving investors, broker dealers and financial advisors.
Moreover, it underscores our commitment to creating diversified capital
sources and income streams and the importance of net lease real estate. This
transaction is expected to position ARCP as the go-to company in the net lease
sector as the industry continues to evolve and consolidate. The combined
company's size, access to low cost equity and debt capital, broad-based
institutional and retail ownership, and exceptional leadership and
organization, will furnish ARCP considerable competitive advantage as the
premier originator of net lease properties and consolidator of net lease
companies. Our valued broker dealer and financial advisor relationships will
continue to be served by the same distinguished professionals following
completion of the merger. Our internal broker dealer, real estate team and the
fine people at Cole who service our distribution partners will continue to
raise capital and manage assets, just as they have done in the past. As I
depart the organization, I do so with the conviction that ARCP will continue
to execute on these principles under the umbrella of 'best practices' and
generate outsized risk-adjusted returns for all of its stockholders. I would
like to thank the employees across our entire organization whose reputations
and performance have been so critical to Cole's success ? I am sure they will
be well served under the experienced leadership team at ARCP.ˇ I am confident
that under ARCP's management the combined entities will continue to build on
Cole's 34-year history and generate outsized risk-adjusted returns for all of
its stockholders.""

Mr. Schorsch added, ""In just over two years after listing ARCP on NASDAQ, we
have built a company with an enterprise value of over $21 billion, subject to
completing this merger, the acquisitions of CapLease and ARCT IV and other
recently announced portfolio purchases and property acquisitions. As we enter
2014, we stand to become the largest listed net lease REIT.ˇ With this
acquisition, we continue to further diversify our asset and tenant base while
driving projected 2014 AFFO per share growth.ˇ This acquisition represents the
continuation of our deliberate and focused growth strategy by improving
profitability, mitigating risk through increased property type and tenant
diversification, constructing a portfolio of properties that produce durable
income and potential asset appreciation while preserving principal, providing
some inflation and interest rate protection and enabling us to deliver AFFO
per share earnings accretion through further cost of capital advantages.ˇ In
addition, the merger with Cole furnishes the size and scale to allow us to
continue to reduce our operating costs as a percentage of assets and
potentially improve our AFFO multiple.""

Strategic Benefits of the Transaction

  oˇEnhanced Scale and Competitiveness: The nature and evolution of the net
    lease industry is conducive to consolidation.ˇ The combination of ARCP and
    Cole creates the world's largest net lease REIT and the 14^th largest
    publicly traded REIT, with a pro forma enterprise value of approximately
    $21.5 billion, approximately 64% larger than its closest net lease REIT
    comparable. With its enhanced scale and balance sheet flexibility, the
    company will be well-positioned to compete for transactions, grow and
    invest in existing relationships, maintain a cost of capital advantage,
    and leverage the talents of both companies.ˇ Company stockholders will
    have the opportunity to share in the compelling upside potential of the
    merger.ˇ
  oˇEnhanced Portfolio Diversification: The pro forma ARCP and Cole combined
    company will have superior portfolio diversification by asset type,
    industry and geography, best-in-class lease maturity profile and
    investment grade tenancy. The combined portfolio will increase the number
    of distinct corporate credit tenants to over 600, occupying over 100
    million square feet in 49 states plus Puerto Rico. The combined portfolio
    is expected to total 3,732 properties with approximately 11 years of
    average remaining lease duration as of year-end 2013.
  oˇOptimization of Both Companies' Core Capabilities and Talent: ARCP's
    combined single-tenant net lease portfolio, together with Cole's
    multi-tenant retail portfolio, will allow the company to leverage its
    capabilities across two complementary sectors.ˇ The multi-tenant retail
    properties coupled with the ""vintage"" (mid-term) net leased properties
    provide significant rent growth potential, especially in an improving
    economy. This complements the stability inherent in the combined company's
    net leased portfolio. In addition, the merger will bring together the
    industry's best talent to form a single, leading professional bench
    comprising the best acquisition teams in the business with some of the
    most important tenant relationships in the net lease space. ARCP and Cole
    have significant integration experience having conducted over $20 billion
    transactions in the past 12 months combined and expect that the
    integration of Cole into ARCP will be seamless.
  oˇPotential for Increased Institutional Coverage / Ownership: Following the
    completion of the merger, ARCP will be well-positioned for a potential
    inclusion in the S&P 500 Index. Such a potential inclusion would broaden
    ARCP's investor base, enhance its visibility and provide added liquidity.

Financial Benefits of the Transaction

  oˇAFFO Growth: ARCP updates AFFO guidance on a pro forma basis for 2014 of
    $1.13 to $1.19 per share, compared with 2013 guidance of $0.91 to $0.95
    per share. Updated guidance allows for potential future dividend growth.
  oˇContinued Strong and Secure Dividends: Stockholders will benefit from
    ARCP's stable and secure dividend with significant growth potential.ˇ ARCP
    will increase its annualized dividend by $0.06, from $0.94 to $1.00 per
    share to take effect upon the close of the Cole merger.ˇ Each company
    intends to continue its current dividend rate until the close of the
    transaction, including ARCP's previously declared $0.03 annual dividend
    increase to take effect upon the earlier to close of the pending CapLease
    or ARCT IV transactions. For Cole stockholders who elect to receive stock
    consideration, annualized dividends per share will increase by
    approximately $0.37, or 52%. The projected AFFO payout ratio falls within
    the ARCP Board target of 85% to 90%.
  oˇOperational Efficiencies and Expense Reductions:  ARCP expects
    approximately $70 million of combined expense synergies and expense
    savings in the first year largely through the reduction and elimination of
    duplicate overhead costs and other non-essential expenses.
  oˇCost of Capital Advantage: ARCP's investment grade rating allows for
    significantly lower cost of financing, which is highly accretive to its
    overall corporate earnings.
  oˇSignificant Value Creation for Cole Stockholders:ˇARCP's offer is valued
    at $14.59 per Cole common share based on the fixed exchange ratio of
    1.0929 and ARCP's closing price of $13.35 on October 22, 2013. The offer
    price represents a premium of 13.8% based on Cole's closing price on
    October 22, 2013 of $12.82.

ARCP Balance Sheet Initiatives
ARCP received an investment grade credit rating of ""Baa3"" with a stable
outlook from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. on October 14, 2013 and has a
multi-pronged balance sheet strategy to maintain a flexible capital structure,
low weighted-average cost of capital, and modest financial leverage.ˇ ARCP
expects to assume approximately $2.8 billion of long-term debt and $500
million of term bank debt to fund the acquisition of Cole, and projects that
its net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA) ratio will decline from 9.1x to 7.7x by year end 2014.ˇ Additional
ARCP balance sheet strategies in 2014 in support of maintaining and improving
its investment grade credit rating include: replacing existing secured
mortgage debt with long-term, fixed rate senior unsecured bonds; extending the
average duration of its debt by retiring pre-payable short-term debt with
long-term debt; and laddering new debt to minimize the amount of debt maturing
in any single future year to reduce its refinancing risk.

ARCP Updates 2014 Earnings Estimates
ARCP has updated 2014 AFFO guidance, which is expected to range from $1.13 to
$1.19 per share, an increase of approximately 25% over the previously issued
2013 AFFO per share guidance of $0.91 to $0.95. ˇARCP's guidance includes the
projected contribution of the earlier to close of the pending transactions
with ARCT IV and CapLease, which together with second half 2013 individual
property acquisitions remain on track.

ARCP Self-Management
ARCP announced on August 20, 2013 that its board had made a decision that the
company will become self-managed by the end of 2013, i.e., that executives and
employees of the current external manager, ARC Properties Advisors, LLC, will
be transferred to the company such that ARCP would benefit from a
fully-integrated management team, with no conflicts and a singular focus on
building and managing ARCP. The existing management agreement with ARC
Properties Advisors, LLC will be terminated with no termination fee payable by
ARCP, and management and operational functions will be internalized. Initial
steps have been taken with the announcement that Nicholas S. Schorsch, the
founder and chairman of ARCP will join ARCP as its Executive Chairman and
interim CEO, pending completion of a search for a new CEO. Mr. Schorsch will
spend a substantial portion of his time in this position.ˇ Brian S. Block, a
seasoned, public company executive and currently the Chief Financial Officer
of ARCP as well as the external manager, will join the new, self-managed ARCP

"            Gentiva? Health Services to Acquire Harden Healthcare

- Increases Focus on Dual Eligible Population

- Combines Leading Home Health, Hospice and Community Care Providers

- Company To Host Call Today at 9:00 a.m. ET

PR Newswire

ATLANTA, Sept. 19, 2013

ATLANTA, Sept. 19, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Gentiva Health Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:
GTIV) (""Gentiva"" or ""the Company""), the largest provider of home health and
hospice services in the United States based on revenue, and Harden Healthcare
Holdings, Inc. (""Harden""), a leading provider of home health, hospice and
community care services, announced today that they have entered into a
definitive merger agreement whereby Gentiva will acquire Harden.ˇˇˇˇ

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Gentiva will acquire Harden's home
health, hospice and community care businesses. Harden's existing shareholders
will retain the company's long-term care business.ˇˇ The purchase price to be
paid by Gentiva is approximately $408.8 million, consisting of $355 million in
cash and approximately $53.8 million in Gentiva common stock.ˇ Gentiva expects
to fund the cash portion of the purchase price through available cash and a
new credit facility.ˇ The Company expects to raise a new $855 million term
loan facility to fund the transaction and refinance its existing term
loans.ˇˇˇˇˇˇ

Founded in 2001 and based in Austin, Texas, Harden operates in 13 states and
has a large presence in Texas and several other south central states.
ˇExcluding its long-term care business, Harden's 2012 consolidated revenue was
approximately $476.0 million.ˇˇ

Based on results from continuing operations for the respective companies' 2012
fiscal years, we anticipate the combination of Gentiva and Harden will create
a company with revenue comprised of 49% home health revenue, 41% hospice
revenue and 10% community care revenue.ˇ The percent of combined company
Medicare revenues for the full-year 2012 would have been 72%, down from 86%
for standalone Gentiva, thereby reducing the Company's Medicare exposure.

As part of the transaction, Gentiva will become a preferred provider for
Harden's 49 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in Texas.

""This transaction is a great strategic fit for Gentiva and we believe it will
provide significant long-term value for our shareholders,"" commented Gentiva
Executive Chairman Rod Windley. ""I consider the Harden transaction a milestone
in the continued Gentiva growth story.ˇ The increasing healthcare needs of an
aging population and ongoing rate pressures will fuel industry consolidation
and Gentiva is positioned to be a leader in this effort.ˇ Additionally, I am
pleased to announce that current Harden Chairman Steve Hicks will be joining
the Gentiva board at the completion of the merger.""

""We are excited to welcome the Harden employees to the Gentiva family,"" said
Gentiva CEO Tony Strange.ˇ ""Harden is recognized as a leader in the post-acute
care continuum for seniors and shares our commitment to quality outcomes,
customer satisfaction and employee engagement, all done in an environment of
compliance.ˇ In addition to further strengthening our core home health and
hospice businesses, this acquisition expands Gentiva's service offerings into
the dual eligibles, which is one of America's most frail populations and a key
priority for federal and state governments as they seek better coordination of
care, reduced costs and improved outcomes.ˇ We believe the combination of
these two companies uniquely positions us to provide pre- and post-acute care
services in the markets we serve.""

Harden CEO Lew Little added, ""This merger represents an exciting opportunity
to bring together two complementary companies that share a commitment to
providing compassionate care and we look forward to better serving our
patients and their families with the expanded resources of the combined
company.""

The transaction was approved by the Board of Directors of each company and by
Harden's shareholders. The transaction is scheduled to close in the fourth
quarter of 2013 and is subject to customary closing conditions.ˇ

The Company expects the acquisition to be accretive to adjusted income per
share, exclusive of one-time costs, within the first 12 months following
closing. Assuming the transaction closes in the fourth quarter of 2013 as
expected, the Company expects combined 2014 revenues to be in the range of
$2.1 billion to $2.2 billion and Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $210.0
million to $220.0 million, excluding the impact of equity-based compensation
expense.

Edge Healthcare Partners, LLC, a division of Edge Corporate Finance, LLC, is
acting as financial advisor to Gentiva.ˇ Greenberg Traurig, LLP is acting as
legal advisor to Gentiva.ˇ Barclays and BofA Merrill Lynch have provided
committed financing for the transaction.ˇˇ

Barclays is acting as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of Harden.ˇ
Alston & Bird LLP is acting as legal advisor to Harden.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The information provided in this press release includes a non-GAAP financial
measure, Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA excludes charges related to
restructuring, legal settlements, acquisition and integration activities and
other special items.ˇ Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to compare operating
results with other companies in the healthcare industry.ˇ Adjusted EBITDA
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable
GAAP measure.

A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Gentiva
shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is not accessible on
a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the inherent
difficulties in predicting the costs of restructuring, legal settlements and
merger and acquisition activities and the impact of any future acquisitions or
divestitures, which can fluctuate significantly and may have a significant
impact on net income.

Conference Call and Webcast Details

The Company will comment further on this transaction during a conference call
and live webcast to be held Thursday, September 19, 2013 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern
Time. To participate in the call from the United States, Canada or an
international location, dial (973) 935-2408 and reference call #68479531. The

?This acquisition further extends Regency?s presence in the Delaware Basin in
West Texas and supports our goal of diversifying our service offerings to our
customers by adding crude and water gathering services,? said Jim Holotik,
executive vice president and chief commercial officer of Regency. ?Hoover?s
geographic footprint enhances our existing Permian Basin service capabilities
and expands our strategic presence in the developing Bone Spring, Wolfcamp and
Wolfbone producing areas.?

Regency expects the acquisition to be accretive in 2014 and to finance the
acquisition by issuing approximately $98 million of Regency common units to
Hoover. The remaining portion of the consideration will be funded from
borrowings under Regency?s revolving credit facility. The acquisition is
expected to close in the first quarter of 2014, and is subject to
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act approval and other customary
closing conditions.

statements. Although we believe our forward-looking statements are based on
reasonable assumptions and current expectations and projections about future
events, we cannot give any assurance that such expectations will prove to be
correct. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks,
uncertainties and assumptions. These risks and uncertainties include the risks
that these transactions may not be consummated or the benefits contemplated
therefrom may not be realized. Additional risks include: volatility in the
price of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, declines in the credit
markets and the availability of credit for the Partnership as well as for
producers connected to the Partnership?s system and its customers, the level
of creditworthiness of, and performance by the Partnership?s counterparties
and customers, the Partnership's ability to access capital to fund organic
growth projects and acquisitions, including significant acquisitions, and the
Partnership?s ability to obtain debt and equity financing on satisfactory
terms, the Partnership's use of derivative financial instruments to hedge
commodity and interest rate risks, the amount of collateral required to be
posted from time-to-time in the Partnership's transactions, changes in
commodity prices, interest rates, and demand for the Partnership's services,

Valeant Pharmaceuticals Agrees to Acquire Solta Medical for $2.92 Per Share in
Cash

Combination Creates a Global Leader in Aesthetics

Transaction Values Solta at Approximately $250 Million

Transaction Expected to Close in the First Quarter of 2014

LAVAL, Quebec and HAYWARD, Calif., Dec. 16, 2013 /CNW/ - Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (NYSE: VRX and TSX: VRX) today announced
that it has entered into a definitive agreement under which Valeant will
acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Solta Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:
SLTM) for $2.92 per share in cash, which represents a 40% premium to Solta's
closing share price on December 13, 2013, the last trading day prior to
announcement, or a transaction value of approximately $250 million.  The
transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014 and Valeant
expects the transaction, once completed, to be immediately accretive to
Valeant's cash earnings per share.

Solta designs, develops, manufactures, and markets energy-based medical device
systems for aesthetic applications.  Solta's products include the Thermage CPT
system that provides non-invasive treatment options using radiofrequency
energy for skin tightening, the Fraxel repair system for use in dermatological
procedures requiring ablation, coagulation, and resurfacing of soft tissue,
the Clear + Brilliant system to improve skin texture and help prevent the
signs of aging skin, and the Liposonix system that destroys unwanted fat cells
resulting in waist circumference reduction.  Solta had total revenue of
approximately $145 million in 2012.

""The acquisition of Solta will bring tremendous value to Valeant's current
aesthetic portfolio and together with our previous acquisitions, will create
the broadest aesthetic portfolio in the industry,"" stated J. Michael Pearson,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Valeant.  ""Solta's leading aesthetic
devices are a natural fit with Valeant's facial injectables, professional skin
care products and physician dispensed products and will establish Valeant in a
strong leadership position as we continue to build our presence in the
aesthetic market.  Moreover, this transaction will further enhance our ability
to offer dermatologists and plastic surgeons the most comprehensive aesthetic
product offering.""

""Our Board of Directors has determined that this all cash offer is in the best
interest of our stockholders. We further believe the acquisition by Valeant
provides the best opportunity for Solta Medical brands and our employees to
achieve their full potential while generating a significant, near term return
for our stockholders,"" stated Mark Sieczkarek, Chairman of the Board and
Interim CEO of Solta Medical. ""Valeant has a proven track record of
successfully integrating a number of major acquisitions into their portfolio
and has established a significant presence in the aesthetics market.  The
addition of Solta's industry leading brands and global sales organization
creates a very compelling platform for future growth in the medical aesthetic
segment.  Our entire team looks forward to executing a smooth transition of
our operations into the Valeant organization.""

Under the terms of the agreement, Valeant will commence a tender offer for all
outstanding shares of Solta at a price of $2.92 per share in cash. The tender
offer will be conditioned on the tender of a majority of Solta's shares
calculated on a diluted basis, as well as the receipt of regulatory approval
and other customary closing conditions. Following the completion of the tender
offer, a wholly owned subsidiary of Valeant will merge with Solta and the
outstanding Solta shares not tendered in the tender offer will be converted
into the right to receive the same $2.92 per share in cash paid in the tender
offer. Solta's Board has unanimously approved the transaction.

Piper Jaffray & Co. acted as financial advisor to Solta and Fenwick & West LLP
acted as legal advisor to Solta.  Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP
acted as legal advisor to Valeant.
